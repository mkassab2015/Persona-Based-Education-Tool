Technical debt is a concept in software development that describes the implied cost of choosing a quick, easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer to implement.

## Key Characteristics:

**Like Financial Debt:**
- You get immediate benefit (faster delivery)
- But you pay "interest" over time (maintenance overhead)
- Eventually needs to be "paid back" (refactored or rewritten)

## Common Examples:

- **Code shortcuts** - Quick fixes that aren't properly designed
- **Outdated dependencies** - Using old libraries or frameworks
- **Poor documentation** - Missing or inadequate code comments
- **Skipped testing** - Insufficient automated tests
- **Architectural compromises** - Suboptimal system design choices

## Types of Technical Debt:

1. **Deliberate** - Conscious trade-offs for business reasons
2. **Accidental** - Results from lack of knowledge or oversight
3. **Environmental** - External changes making current solutions obsolete

## Consequences:

- Slower development over time
- Higher maintenance costs
- Increased bug risk
- Reduced team productivity
- Difficulty adding new features

## Management Strategies:

- **Track it** - Document debt as it's created
- **Prioritize** - Address high-impact debt first
- **Budget time** - Allocate regular time for debt reduction
- **Prevent accumulation** - Establish coding standards and review processes

The key is finding the right balance between speed and quality, while being intentional about when you incur technical debt and having a plan to address it.
