I’m not Kent Beck, but here’s a practical way to use a Kanban board that’s faithful to Extreme Programming’s values: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect.

Why the board exists
- Make problems visible so you can fix them.
- Optimize flow of value, not local efficiency.
- Encourage small, safe steps and rapid feedback.

Design the board around reality, not wishful thinking
- Columns reflect how work really moves today. Start simple: Options (triage) → Ready → Implementing (pair/mob) → Validating (ATs, exploratory) → Deploying → Done.
- If testing is part of development (XP), don’t create a big “throw over the wall” QA column. Validation is about acceptance and exploration, not compensating for low code quality.
- Add explicit policies under each column (entry/exit rules, who pulls, quality checks).
- Show Blocked with a bright tag, not a separate column (blocked work still counts against WIP).
- Add an Expedite lane with a strict rule: at most 1 item; the team swarms; run a postmortem afterward.

Set real WIP limits (and honor them)
- Total WIP across “in-progress” columns should match team capacity. As a rule of thumb, WIP = number of pairs (or pairs + 1).
- When a limit is hit, you finish or swarm; you don’t start something new.
- Track work item age (e.g., a dot per day). Aging items trigger swarming.

Make work small and independently valuable
- Slice stories so most finish in about a day. Vertical slices; real user outcomes.
- Definition of Ready: clear example(s) of behavior, observable outcome, no hidden dependencies. Keep the Ready queue small (just a few days of work).

Run it with simple cadences
- Daily flow review at the board (10–15 minutes):
  - What is blocked or aging?
  - Where are WIP limits broken?
  - Who will swarm to finish?
  - Is the build green? If not, stop the line.
- Replenishment 1–2 times/week:
  - Choose the next small items based on cost of delay.
  - Confirm DoR and acceptance examples.
- Delivery: integrate and deploy continuously. Decouple deploy from release if needed.
- Retrospective weekly or biweekly: one experiment to improve flow, not a laundry list.

Build quality in with XP practices
- Pair or mob program to eliminate big-batch code review.
- TDD and merciless refactoring keep changes small and safe.
- Trunk-based development and a green mainline are non-negotiable.
- Definition of Done: integrated, tested (unit + acceptance), observable in a staging/prod-like environment, releasable.

Measure to learn, not to game
- Track:
  - Cycle time (start to done): look at median and 85th percentile.
  - Throughput per week.
  - Work item age (for items in progress).
  - WIP.
- Use these to set a service-level expectation: e.g., “85% of items complete within 4 days.”
- A cumulative flow diagram helps spot bottlenecks and starvation.
- Drop story points; forecast with historical throughput.

Use slack deliberately
- Keep a bit of capacity for improving tests, build, observability, and deployment. Slack isn’t waste; it’s what keeps flow smooth and change cheap.

Make policies explicit and visible
- Start finishing before starting.
- Stop the line when the build breaks.
- Pairing policy (who pairs, how often to rotate).
- Expedite policy and aftercare.
- How defects are handled (treat like any other item; prioritize based on impact).

Adapt by context (3X lens)
- Explore: maximize learning with very small experiments; expect higher variability; protect quality.
- Expand: raise throughput; watch WIP and reduce handoffs.
- Extract: simplify, pay down debt, tighten WIP for predictability.

Antipatterns to avoid
- Too many columns and handoffs; the board becomes a museum.
- Ignoring WIP limits or having limits so high they’re meaningless.
- A permanent testing/QA queue as a quality crutch.
- Overusing Expedite.
- Letting the board lag reality; if it’s not updated in real time, it’s theater.

A simple starter recipe
- Columns: Ready (WIP 3–5), Implementing (WIP = number of pairs), Validating (WIP 1–2), Deploying (WIP 1), Done.
- Blocked tag; aging dots daily.
- One-week experiment: cut WIP by 1 and slice stories smaller. Measure cycle time and discuss the impact.
- After two weeks, introduce SLE (“85% ≤ X days”) and use it for stakeholder conversations.

The spirit is continuous improvement: expose constraints, change one thing at a time, watch the data, and keep the technical practices strong so small, safe steps remain possible.
