Requirements engineering is essential for several critical reasons:

## **Preventing Project Failure**
- **Reduces risk**: Most software project failures stem from poor, incomplete, or misunderstood requirements
- **Saves costs**: Fixing requirement errors early is exponentially cheaper than fixing them after development or deployment
- **Avoids scope creep**: Clear requirements help prevent uncontrolled changes that derail projects

## **Ensuring Stakeholder Alignment**
- **Common understanding**: Creates shared vision among developers, clients, users, and business stakeholders
- **Manages expectations**: Establishes what will and won't be delivered
- **Facilitates communication**: Provides a structured way to discuss and document needs

## **Guiding Development Process**
- **Design foundation**: Requirements serve as the blueprint for system architecture and design
- **Testing criteria**: Defines what needs to be tested and acceptance criteria
- **Progress measurement**: Enables tracking of development progress against defined goals

## **Quality Assurance**
- **Completeness**: Ensures all necessary functionality is identified and addressed
- **Consistency**: Eliminates contradictions and ambiguities in system specifications
- **Traceability**: Links business needs to technical implementation

## **Legal and Contractual Protection**
- **Documentation**: Provides formal record of agreed-upon deliverables
- **Change management**: Establishes process for handling requirement modifications
- **Dispute resolution**: Serves as reference point for resolving disagreements

Without proper requirements engineering, projects often suffer from budget overruns, missed deadlines, and systems that don't meet user needs.
