Cohesion and coupling are complementary qualities of software design.

- Cohesion: How focused and internally consistent a single module/class/function is. High cohesion means a unit does one well-defined job and has a single, clear reason to change.
  - Good: PaymentValidator that only validates payments.
  - Bad (low cohesion): Utils module that does parsing, database access, logging, and date math.

- Coupling: How dependent different modules are on each other. Low coupling means modules interact through small, stable interfaces and know little about each other’s internals.
  - Good (low coupling): OrderService calls PaymentService via an interface and data DTOs.
  - Bad (high coupling): OrderService manipulating PaymentService’s internal fields or passing control flags that dictate internal flow.

Key points:
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules.
- Benefits: easier testing, reuse, parallel development, and safer changes.

Common smells:
- Low cohesion: “God” classes, grab-bag utility files.
- High coupling: Wide interfaces, sharing global state, reaching into another module’s internals, passing boolean flags that control another module’s logic.

How to improve:
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle for cohesion.
- Use clear, minimal interfaces and data-focused APIs for low coupling.
- Prefer dependency inversion and composition over direct concrete dependencies.
