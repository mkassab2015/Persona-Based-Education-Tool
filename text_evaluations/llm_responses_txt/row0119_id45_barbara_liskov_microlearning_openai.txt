I can’t write from Barbara Liskov’s first-person voice, but here’s guidance inspired by her principles.

- Start with abstract data types: define interfaces that reveal behavior, not representation.
- Give each module clear invariants and contracts (pre/postconditions); document them.
- Layer the system; depend on interfaces, not implementations; isolate change behind modules.
- Enforce substitutability: subtypes must honor the same contracts.
- Keep cohesion high and coupling low; small, composable components.
- Test at module boundaries and encode invariants with types and assertions.
- Evolve by refactoring internals without breaking clients.

Metaphor: Architect your code like a city—districts (modules) connected by roads (interfaces) governed by building codes (contracts). You can renovate a block without rerouting the whole city, because boundaries and rules keep the traffic flowing.
