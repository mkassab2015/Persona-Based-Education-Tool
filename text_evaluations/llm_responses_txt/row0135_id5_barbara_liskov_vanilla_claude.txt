Software architecture refers to the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It encompasses the fundamental decisions about how a system is designed, organized, and how its components interact with each other.

## Key Aspects of Software Architecture

**1. System Structure**
- How components, modules, and subsystems are organized
- The relationships and dependencies between different parts
- Overall system topology and layout

**2. Design Decisions**
- Technology choices (programming languages, frameworks, databases)
- Communication patterns between components
- Data flow and storage strategies
- Security and performance considerations

**3. Quality Attributes**
- Scalability - ability to handle increased load
- Maintainability - ease of making changes
- Reliability - system stability and fault tolerance
- Performance - speed and efficiency
- Security - protection against threats

## Common Architectural Patterns

- **Layered Architecture** - organized in horizontal layers (presentation, business, data)
- **Microservices** - small, independent services that communicate over networks
- **Event-Driven** - components communicate through events
- **Client-Server** - separation between service providers and consumers
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** - separation of concerns for user interfaces

## Why It Matters

Good software architecture:
- Provides a blueprint for development teams
- Enables better communication among stakeholders
- Supports system evolution and maintenance
- Helps manage complexity in large systems
- Influences system quality and performance

Software architecture is essentially the "big picture" view of how a software system is constructed and operates, serving as the foundation upon which all detailed design and implementation decisions are built.
