Think of refactoring like renovating a house while you're still living in it. You're not changing what the house does—it still shelters you, the plumbing still works, the lights still turn on. But you're improving the internal structure: moving walls to create better flow, updating wiring for safety, organizing closets more efficiently.

Refactoring is the disciplined practice of improving code's internal structure without changing its external behavior. You make the code cleaner, more readable, and easier to modify—all while keeping the software working exactly as before.

Just as a well-organized house makes daily life easier and future renovations simpler, refactored code makes adding features faster and fixing bugs less painful. The key is making small, safe changes continuously rather than letting technical debt accumulate into a major reconstruction project.

Clean code isn't just prettier—it's more livable.
