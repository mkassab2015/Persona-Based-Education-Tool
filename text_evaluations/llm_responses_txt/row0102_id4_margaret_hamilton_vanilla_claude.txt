**Verification** and **validation** are two distinct but complementary quality assurance processes:

## Verification
- **"Are we building the product right?"**
- Ensures the product meets specified requirements and design specifications
- Focuses on adherence to standards, processes, and documentation
- Typically involves:
  - Code reviews
  - Design reviews
  - Testing against specifications
  - Static analysis
- Can often be done without executing the actual product

## Validation
- **"Are we building the right product?"**
- Ensures the product meets the actual needs and expectations of end users
- Focuses on whether the product solves the intended problem
- Typically involves:
  - User acceptance testing
  - Field testing
  - Beta testing
  - Real-world scenario testing
- Requires executing/using the actual product

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Focus** | Requirements compliance | User needs fulfillment |
| **When** | Throughout development | Near/at end of development |
| **Method** | Reviews, inspections, analysis | Testing with real users/scenarios |
| **Question** | Does it match specs? | Does it work for users? |

## Example
For a mobile banking app:
- **Verification**: Checking if the login feature encrypts passwords as specified in requirements
- **Validation**: Testing if real customers can easily and securely access their accounts in real-world conditions

Both are essential for delivering quality products that are both technically correct and truly useful.
