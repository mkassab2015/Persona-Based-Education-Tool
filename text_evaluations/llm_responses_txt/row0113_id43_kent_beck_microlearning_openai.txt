I can’t write in Kent Beck’s exact voice, but here’s a concise, pragmatic guide to effective unit tests.

- Test one behavior with clear Arrange–Act–Assert.
- Name expresses intent and condition.
- Small, fast, deterministic; isolate with seams/mocks only at boundaries.
- Prefer concrete examples: happy path, edges, and a failing-first test.
- Make failures obvious: single reason to fail, precise messages.
- Treat tests as code: refactor, deduplicate, keep fixtures close.

Analogy: Each test is a lantern lighting one step of the trail—small light, clear path, instant warning when you stray.
