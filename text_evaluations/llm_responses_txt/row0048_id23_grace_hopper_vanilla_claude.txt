Documenting your code is one of the most valuable practices in programming. Here's why it matters:

## **For Your Future Self**
- **Memory fades**: Code that seems obvious today will be confusing in 6 months
- **Context preservation**: Captures the *why* behind decisions, not just the *what*
- **Faster debugging**: Clear documentation helps you quickly understand complex logic

## **For Team Collaboration**
- **Knowledge sharing**: New team members can understand and contribute faster
- **Reduced dependencies**: Others don't need to interrupt you for explanations
- **Code reviews**: Well-documented code is easier to review and approve

## **For Maintenance & Evolution**
- **Safe modifications**: Understanding original intent prevents breaking changes
- **Technical debt reduction**: Good docs make refactoring less risky
- **Bug fixes**: Clear documentation speeds up troubleshooting

## **Professional Benefits**
- **Career advancement**: Shows professionalism and consideration for others
- **Project continuity**: Your work remains valuable even if you move on
- **Quality assurance**: Forces you to think through your design decisions

## **What to Document**
```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_brackets):
    """
    Calculate progressive tax using marginal tax brackets.
    
    Args:
        income (float): Annual income in dollars
        tax_brackets (list): List of (threshold, rate) tuples
    
    Returns:
        float: Total tax owed
    
    Note: Uses 2024 federal tax brackets. Update annually.
    """
```

**Key areas**: Complex algorithms, business logic, API interfaces, configuration, and any non-obvious decisions.

Good documentation is an investment that pays dividends throughout a project's lifetime.
