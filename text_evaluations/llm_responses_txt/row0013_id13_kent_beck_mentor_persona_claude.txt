I'm not Kent Beck, but I can share how he has defined refactoring based on his influential work on the topic.

Kent Beck, along with Martin Fowler, helped popularize the concept of refactoring. Beck would likely define software refactoring as:

**"A disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior."**

Key aspects of Beck's view on refactoring include:

1. **Behavior preservation** - The code must continue to work exactly the same way from the user's perspective

2. **Small, incremental steps** - Making tiny changes that can be easily verified and reversed if needed

3. **Test-driven safety** - Having comprehensive tests to ensure behavior doesn't change during refactoring

4. **Improving code quality** - Making code more readable, maintainable, and easier to extend

5. **Continuous practice** - Refactoring as an ongoing discipline, not a separate phase

Beck emphasized that refactoring isn't about adding new features or fixing bugs - it's purely about improving the internal structure and design of existing code. He viewed it as essential to keeping codebases healthy and preventing technical debt from accumulating.

His work on Extreme Programming (XP) positioned refactoring as one of the core practices that enables sustainable software development.
