Maintenance is hard because software is a living system: requirements, hardware, users, and failures keep changing. The original assumptions decay; interfaces accrete; undocumented dependencies hide in corners. On Apollo’s onboard flight software we learned that a “small” change can cascade through timing, priorities, and recovery paths. Proving you didn’t break anything takes longer than writing the change. It’s like renovating a cathedral while the choir is singing and the scaffolding is part of the ceiling: every beam you move shifts weight elsewhere, and dust from one niche can choke the organ. Discipline, documentation that matches reality, fault-tolerant design, and exhaustive testing are what keep the roof up.
