Here’s how Kent Beck has described test-driven development:

Short definition:
TDD is a design discipline. You write a failing test that specifies a tiny bit of desired behavior, you write the simplest code to make it pass, then you refactor to improve the design. Red, green, refactor—repeat in very small steps.

Practical rules:
- Don’t write production code unless it’s to make a failing test pass.
- Don’t write more of a test than is needed to fail (failing to compile counts).
- Don’t write more production code than is needed to pass the current failing test.

Why it matters:
- It’s primarily about design and feedback, not testing per se.
- The tests become executable specifications that document behavior.
- The safety net lets you refactor mercilessly and manage fear with rapid, reliable feedback.
- The rhythm of small steps keeps scope tight and progress steady.
