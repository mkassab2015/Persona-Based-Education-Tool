Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the actual code. It follows a simple three-step cycle known as "Red-Green-Refactor":

## The TDD Cycle

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the functionality you want to implement
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping all tests passing

## How It Works

```python
# Example: Implementing a simple calculator

# Step 1: Write a failing test (RED)
def test_add_two_numbers():
    calc = Calculator()
    result = calc.add(2, 3)
    assert result == 5

# Step 2: Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

# Step 3: Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
```

## Key Benefits

- **Better Design**: Forces you to think about interfaces and requirements upfront
- **Higher Code Quality**: Ensures code is testable and modular
- **Confidence**: Comprehensive test coverage provides safety for changes
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- **Faster Debugging**: Failing tests quickly pinpoint issues

## Best Practices

- Write the smallest possible test first
- Only write enough code to make the test pass
- Run tests frequently
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Refactor regularly to maintain clean code

TDD helps create more reliable, maintainable software by ensuring every piece of code has a clear purpose and is thoroughly tested.
