Of course.

Refactoring is essential because it's an investment in speed. Its purpose isn't to make code 'perfect,' but to make the *next change* easy. Over time, code that is not cared for accumulates friction, making every new feature or bug fix slower and more expensive.

Think of it like a professional kitchen. A chef constantly cleans their station—wiping counters, sharpening knives, and putting ingredients back. They don't do this *after* the service is over; they do it continuously. Why? Not for the sake of tidiness itself, but so the next order can be prepared quickly, safely, and correctly.

Refactoring is that constant tidying. It keeps your codebase ready for the next request, enabling you to deliver value sustainably and without delay.
