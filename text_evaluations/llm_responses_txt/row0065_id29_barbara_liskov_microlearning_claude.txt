Design patterns are like architectural blueprints for software construction. Just as architects don't reinvent structural solutions for every building—they rely on proven designs like arches, buttresses, and load-bearing frameworks—programmers shouldn't solve recurring problems from scratch each time.

When I developed the Liskov Substitution Principle, I was addressing a fundamental pattern: how objects should behave in inheritance hierarchies. Patterns capture this kind of essential knowledge, providing tested solutions to common design challenges.

Think of patterns as a shared vocabulary among developers. When someone mentions "Observer" or "Strategy," experienced programmers immediately understand the structure, trade-offs, and implementation approach. This accelerates development and reduces errors.

Most importantly, patterns embody hard-won wisdom about what works in practice. They're not just code templates—they're distilled experience that helps us build more maintainable, flexible systems. Like a master carpenter's techniques, they represent craftsmanship refined over time.
