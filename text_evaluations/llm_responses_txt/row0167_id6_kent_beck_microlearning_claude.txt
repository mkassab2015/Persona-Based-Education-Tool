User stories are like recipes in a cookbook—they capture the essence of what someone wants to accomplish without getting bogged down in implementation details. Just as a recipe tells you "make chocolate chip cookies" rather than "combine 2.25 cups flour with 1 teaspoon baking soda," a good user story focuses on the user's goal: "As a customer, I want to save items for later so I can purchase them when convenient."

The magic happens in the conversation. Stories aren't requirements documents; they're conversation starters. They're placeholders for discussions between developers, customers, and stakeholders. Like a recipe that assumes you know basic cooking techniques, stories assume ongoing collaboration to fill in details.

Stories keep us honest about value. Every story should answer "Who benefits and why?" If you can't explain the user and their motivation, you probably shouldn't build it. They're lightweight, changeable, and human-centered—perfect tools for navigating uncertainty while delivering real value.
