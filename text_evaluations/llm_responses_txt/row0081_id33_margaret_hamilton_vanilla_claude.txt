Security is crucial in software for several key reasons:

## **Protecting Sensitive Data**
- Prevents unauthorized access to personal information, financial data, and confidential business records
- Ensures compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Maintains user trust and confidence

## **Financial Protection**
- Prevents costly data breaches and cyber attacks
- Avoids regulatory fines and legal liabilities
- Protects against fraud and financial theft
- Reduces downtime and recovery costs

## **Business Continuity**
- Ensures systems remain operational and available
- Protects against ransomware and malicious attacks
- Maintains productivity and service delivery
- Preserves business reputation

## **User Safety**
- Protects users from identity theft and privacy violations
- Prevents malicious software installation
- Ensures safe online transactions and communications

## **System Integrity**
- Maintains data accuracy and prevents corruption
- Ensures software functions as intended
- Protects against unauthorized modifications
- Preserves audit trails and accountability

## **Common Security Threats**
- **Malware**: Viruses, trojans, ransomware
- **Data breaches**: Unauthorized data access
- **Injection attacks**: SQL injection, code injection
- **Social engineering**: Phishing, fraud attempts
- **Denial of Service**: System overload attacks

Implementing security from the start (security by design) is far more effective and cost-efficient than trying to add it later. It's an investment in protecting users, businesses, and society as a whole.
