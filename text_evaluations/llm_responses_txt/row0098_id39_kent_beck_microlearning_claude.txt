Think of code like a garden. When you first plant it, everything looks neat and organized. But as it grows, weeds creep in, paths become overgrown, and what once made sense becomes a tangled mess.

Refactoring is your pruning shears and rake. You're not changing what grows in the garden—the functionality stays the same. But you're constantly tidying: clearing dead branches, creating clearer pathways, grouping related plants together.

Without this ongoing care, your garden becomes increasingly difficult to navigate and maintain. New features become harder to add, bugs hide in the undergrowth, and eventually, the whole system becomes so unwieldy that even simple changes feel impossible.

The magic is that refactoring makes your code easier to understand and modify, which directly translates to faster development and fewer bugs. It's not about perfection—it's about keeping your codebase healthy and workable.
