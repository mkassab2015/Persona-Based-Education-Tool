Bugs happen for several interconnected reasons:

## Human Factors
- **Complexity overwhelms us** - Modern software has millions of lines of code, making it impossible to mentally track all interactions
- **Communication gaps** - Requirements get misunderstood between stakeholders, designers, and developers
- **Cognitive limitations** - We miss edge cases, make typos, or have logical blind spots
- **Time pressure** - Rushing leads to shortcuts and insufficient testing

## Technical Challenges
- **Integration issues** - Different components, libraries, or systems don't work together as expected
- **Environment differences** - Code behaves differently across operating systems, browsers, or hardware
- **Concurrency problems** - Multiple processes accessing shared resources create race conditions
- **External dependencies** - Third-party services, APIs, or libraries change unexpectedly

## Process Issues
- **Inadequate testing** - Not covering all scenarios, especially unusual user behaviors
- **Changing requirements** - New features break existing functionality
- **Technical debt** - Quick fixes accumulate into fragile, hard-to-maintain code

## Fundamental Reality
Software development is essentially **managing complexity at scale**. Even with best practices, perfect bug-free software is practically impossible because:
- Requirements evolve
- Users behave unpredictably  
- Technology ecosystems constantly change
- Human judgment has inherent limitations

The goal isn't eliminating all bugs, but building systems robust enough to handle failures gracefully and processes good enough to catch critical issues early.
