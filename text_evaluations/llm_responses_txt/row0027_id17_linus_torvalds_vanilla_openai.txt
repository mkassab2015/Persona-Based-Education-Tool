DevOps is a culture and set of practices that unify software development and IT operations to deliver software faster, more reliably, and more securely.

Key ideas:
- Culture of collaboration and shared ownership across dev, ops, security, and product
- Automation of the software lifecycle: build, test, release, deploy, operate
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Small, frequent changes; fast feedback; “shift-left” testing and security
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and immutable, repeatable environments
- Observability, monitoring, and blameless incident response
- Data-driven improvement using metrics (e.g., DORA: lead time, deploy frequency, change failure rate, MTTR)

Common practices and tools:
- Version control everything (Git)
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI)
- Automated testing and code quality gates
- IaC and config management (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)
- Containers and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Security integrated into pipelines (DevSecOps), secrets management (Vault)
- Monitoring, logging, tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, OpenTelemetry, Datadog)

Relationship to other disciplines:
- Complements Agile (team/product delivery practices)
- Overlaps with SRE, which emphasizes reliability with SLOs and error budgets

Common pitfalls:
- Treating DevOps as just tools or a separate siloed “DevOps team”
- Large, risky releases instead of small, frequent changes

How to start:
- Pick one service, map the delivery flow, remove manual bottlenecks
- Implement CI, automated tests, and a basic CD pipeline
- Manage infrastructure with code; use feature flags for safe releases
- Add monitoring and run blameless postmortems to learn and improve
