Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically multiple times per day. Each integration is automatically verified by running automated builds and tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

## Key Components of CI:

**1. Frequent Code Integration**
- Developers commit code changes regularly (daily or multiple times per day)
- Changes are merged into a main branch or trunk

**2. Automated Build Process**
- Every code commit triggers an automated build
- The system compiles the code and creates executable artifacts

**3. Automated Testing**
- Unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests run with each build
- Quick feedback on whether changes break existing functionality

**4. Fast Feedback**
- Developers receive immediate notification of build/test failures
- Issues are identified and fixed quickly while context is fresh

## Benefits of CI:

- **Early Bug Detection**: Problems are caught soon after introduction
- **Reduced Integration Risk**: Smaller, frequent changes are easier to debug
- **Improved Code Quality**: Consistent testing and validation
- **Faster Development**: Less time spent on debugging integration issues
- **Better Collaboration**: Team stays synchronized with latest changes

## Common CI Tools:
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Travis CI
- CircleCI
- Azure DevOps

CI is often paired with Continuous Deployment (CD) to create a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire software delivery process from code commit to production deployment.
