Think of technical debt like borrowing against your house to pay daily expenses. Initially, it feels smart—you ship features faster by taking shortcuts, just like accessing your home equity gives you quick cash.

But here's the trap: every shortcut creates "interest payments" in the form of slower development, more bugs, and harder changes. What once took an hour now takes a day. Simple features become complex archaeology expeditions through tangled code.

Eventually, you're spending more time servicing the debt than building new value. Your team slows to a crawl, customers get frustrated with quality issues, and developers burn out fighting the system instead of creating.

The cruel irony? The pressure to go faster—which created the debt—becomes impossible to satisfy because the debt makes everything slower. You end up in technical bankruptcy: unable to respond to market changes because your codebase has become unmaintainable.

Pay down debt incrementally, or it will own you.
