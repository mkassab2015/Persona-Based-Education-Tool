We start with a simple, powerful belief: technology should get out of the way. Most companies build a complex engine and then hand you a user manual. We do the opposite. We relentlessly subtract the obvious and add the meaningful until all that remains is the essential.

Think of it like a river stone. For a thousand years, the water has washed away every sharp edge, every unnecessary grain, leaving only a perfectly smooth, intuitive form that feels natural in your hand.

That’s a user interface. It should be so simple and self-evident that you forget it’s even there, freeing you to simply create and do. It just works.
