Agile's popularity stems from its honest confrontation with uncertainty. We are terrible at predicting the future, yet traditional methods demand we create a perfect, detailed plan at the start—the moment we know the least.

This is like planning a cross-country road trip by printing out a map and vowing to follow it exactly, ignoring all traffic, construction, or interesting detours that appear. You will inevitably get stuck.

Agile is like using a GPS. You have a destination in mind, but you navigate turn-by-turn, using constant, real-time feedback to find the best path. It replaces the anxiety of perfectly executing a flawed plan with the confidence of continually steering toward value. This relentless cycle of learning and adapting is its true power.
