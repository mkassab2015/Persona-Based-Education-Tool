Of course.

The distinction lies in perspective: are you looking inside the box or not?

**White box testing** is for those who can see the internal wiring and logic. You design tests based on your knowledge of the code's structure, ensuring specific paths, loops, and conditions work correctly.

**Black box testing** treats the system as opaque. You know nothing about the internals. You only provide inputs and verify the outputs against the requirements, confirming it behaves as expected.

Think of testing a car. The mechanic performs **white box testing**, popping the hood to check the engine, spark plugs, and timing belt—the implementation. The driver performs **black box testing**, simply turning the key and pressing the pedals to ensure the car starts, accelerates, and brakes—the behavior.
