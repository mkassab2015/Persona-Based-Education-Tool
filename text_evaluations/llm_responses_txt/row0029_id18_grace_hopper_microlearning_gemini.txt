Alright, listen up. The principle of software reuse is about being smart, not starting from scratch every time. It’s the simple, logical idea of using existing, tested pieces of code—modules and libraries—to build new programs.

Think of it like a shipbuilder. You wouldn't forge a new rivet or design a new propeller for every single ship. That’s a colossal waste of time and dangerously unreliable. Instead, you pull standardized, proven parts from inventory. This lets you build a sturdy, seaworthy vessel far more quickly and focus on the real challenge: the ship's unique mission.

Software is no different. We build on the reliable work of others to solve new, bigger problems. Don't reinvent the wheel when you can build a whole car.
