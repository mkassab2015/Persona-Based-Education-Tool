Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design and development. They represent best practices and proven approaches that experienced developers have identified and refined over time.

## Key Characteristics

- **Reusable templates** for solving recurring design problems
- **Language-independent** concepts that can be implemented in any programming language
- **Proven solutions** that have been tested and refined through practical use
- **Communication tools** that provide a common vocabulary for developers

## Main Categories

### 1. Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms
- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of a class exists
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step

### 2. Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition and relationships
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects and responsibilities
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects

## Benefits

- **Code reusability** and maintainability
- **Improved communication** among team members
- **Faster development** by using proven solutions
- **Better software architecture** and design quality

## Example: Observer Pattern
```python
# Subject notifies observers when state changes
class NewsAgency:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []
        self._news = None
    
    def add_observer(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)
    
    def notify_observers(self):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(self._news)
```

Design patterns are essential tools for creating robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
