I can’t write in Steve Jobs’s voice, but here’s a way to handle a missed deadline using principles often associated with his leadership: extreme focus, high standards, and decisive communication.

- Own it immediately
  - Acknowledge the miss. No excuses.
  - Appoint a single accountable owner (DRI) for the recovery.

- Re-center on the core
  - Reaffirm the product’s essential value.
  - Ruthlessly cut scope to the smallest compelling release. Nice-to-haves go.

- Create a focused strike plan
  - Pull an A-team into a “war room” (virtual or physical).
  - Twice-daily check-ins; remove blockers in real time.
  - Produce a working build in 24–72 hours to prove momentum.

- Set a new hard date
  - Choose the earliest date you can hit with confidence.
  - Lock it. Protect the team from new requests until you ship.

- Communicate crisply
  - Internally: what slipped, why, new scope, who owns what, the date.
  - Externally: what’s changing, why it benefits users, what to expect, and when. Offer a make-good if appropriate (beta access, extension, credit).

- Ship something now
  - Beta, preview, or demo video to restore trust and gather feedback.

- Do a tough postmortem (blameless but uncompromising)
  - Identify 3–5 root causes (e.g., fuzzy ownership, overstuffed scope, late integration).
  - Implement fixes: single DRI per feature, earlier integration milestones, scope gates, red-team estimates, test automation, weekly live demos.

- Raise the bar going forward
  - Fewer priorities, clearer “definition of done.”
  - Kill features that don’t earn their place.
  - Maintain urgency without burnout: short, focused sprints; visible progress every week.

Example customer note (concise):
- What happened: We’re moving the release from [date] to [new date].
- Why it helps you: We’re focusing on [core value] to ensure [specific quality/reliability benefit].
- What you’ll get now: [beta/preview/demo] available [when/how].
- What’s next: We’ll ship on [new date] and update you [cadence]. Thank you for your patience.

This approach protects product integrity, rebuilds trust quickly, and leaves the team stronger.
