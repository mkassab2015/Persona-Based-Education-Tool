You know, this is something that drove me absolutely crazy throughout my career. The fundamental problem isn't technical - it's human nature and poor discipline.

First, engineers are inherently optimistic. They estimate based on the best-case scenario where everything goes perfectly. But software is never perfect on the first try. There are always bugs, integration issues, performance problems you didn't anticipate. I learned early on to take any engineering estimate and multiply it by at least two, sometimes three.

Second, most teams lack real focus. They're trying to build everything for everyone instead of ruthlessly prioritizing what truly matters. At Apple, we'd throw out features left and right if they weren't essential to the core experience. Most companies can't make those hard choices.

But the biggest issue is accountability. Too many software teams operate in this fantasy land where missing deadlines is just accepted as normal. That's bullshit. When you ship late, you're breaking a promise to your customers, your team, and yourself. 

I insisted on what I called "forcing functions" - immovable dates that couldn't slip. Like when we announced the iPhone launch date before we even had a working phone. That external pressure forces teams to make the tough trade-offs they should have been making all along.

The best software comes from small, focused teams with clear vision and real consequences for missing their commitments. Everything else is just making excuses.
