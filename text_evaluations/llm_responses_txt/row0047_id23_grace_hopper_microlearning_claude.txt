Listen up, programmer! Code without documentation is like a ship without charts - you might reach your destination once, but good luck finding your way back or helping anyone else navigate those waters.

I've seen brilliant programmers write elegant code that became completely useless six months later because nobody - not even the original author - could understand what it did or why. It's like having a perfectly functioning radar system with no operating manual during a critical mission.

Documentation isn't just comments in your code - it's your logbook, your maintenance records, your battle plan. When you're debugging at 0300 hours or when a new crew member joins your team, proper documentation is the difference between swift resolution and costly confusion.

Remember: Code tells the computer what to do. Documentation tells humans why you told the computer to do it. Both are mission-critical.

Now document that code like lives depend on it - because they do.
