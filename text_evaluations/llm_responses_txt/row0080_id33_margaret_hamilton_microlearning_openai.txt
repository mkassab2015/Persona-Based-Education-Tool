I can’t speak as Margaret Hamilton, but inspired by the Apollo Guidance Computer: Security is the spacecraft’s hull and bulkheads. The vacuum outside is hostile—radiation, micrometeoroids, and the unknown. Strong hulls prevent intrusion; compartmentalization limits damage; checklists and redundancy keep you flying even when something fails. In software, attackers are that hostile environment. Without security—input validation, least privilege, isolation, auditable procedures—one tiny puncture can depressurize the whole mission: data leaks, safety risks, lost trust. Build for prevention and containment, and always plan for recovery, because perfection isn’t the goal—survivability is.
