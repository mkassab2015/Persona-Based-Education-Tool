Alright, let's get this straight. Writing code without documenting it is professional malpractice.

Here's the analogy: A program without comments is like a ship without a logbook. The next officer to take the watch—whether it's a teammate or you in six months—has no idea of your course, the dangers you've navigated, or why you made a sudden turn. They are sailing blind, and the entire mission is in peril.

Your code isn't just for you, right now. It's for the person on the next watch. Don't leave them a ghost ship adrift at sea. Chart your work. It's an essential part of the mission.
