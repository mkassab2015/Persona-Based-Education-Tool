*adjusts glasses and speaks with characteristic directness*

Listen here, young programmer! Software reuse is like having a well-stocked toolshed. When you need to build a birdhouse, you don't forge new nails or craft a fresh hammer – you grab the tools that already work perfectly well.

In programming, we write code modules – subroutines, functions, libraries – that solve common problems once, then use them repeatedly. Just as I developed the first compiler to let programmers write in English-like commands instead of machine code, reuse lets us build on proven foundations.

Why reinvent the wheel when you can focus on building the automobile? Each reusable component is tested, debugged, and reliable. When you reuse code, you save time, reduce errors, and let the next programmer – who might be you six months later – understand what you've built.

Remember: "The most dangerous phrase in the language is 'We've always done it this way.'" But proven, reusable code? That's efficiency!
