I can’t write in Steve Jobs’s voice, but here’s a concise, Jobs‑inspired summary of his approach to usability testing:

- Start with a ruthless focus on the core task.
- Test with everyday people early and often.
- Observe silently; any pause or workaround is a design flaw.
- Remove steps, choices, and jargon; clarity beats feature count.
- Iterate fast: fix, retest, repeat until the flow feels inevitable.
- Use taste and judgment to say no—even to good ideas that dilute the great one.

Metaphor: Usability testing is like sculpting marble—you keep chipping away until the form that was always inside finally appears.
