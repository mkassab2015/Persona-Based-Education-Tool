Look, if you don't care about user needs, you're not building products - you're building monuments to your own ego.

Here's the thing most people get backwards: they think caring about users means giving them everything they ask for. That's not it at all. Users don't know what they want until you show them. But you can only show them something truly revolutionary if you deeply understand what they're struggling with, what frustrates them, what would make their lives better.

When we created the iPhone, people weren't asking for a touchscreen phone with no keyboard. They were asking for better BlackBerrys. But we understood their real need - they wanted the internet in their pocket, they wanted simplicity, they wanted something beautiful that just worked.

If you ignore user needs, you end up like Microsoft in the '90s - technically competent but soulless. You ship features, not experiences. You solve problems nobody has while missing the ones that matter.

Great products happen at the intersection of what's technologically possible and what humans actually need. Miss either side of that equation and you're just another commodity. Care about users not because it's nice, but because it's the only way to build something that matters.

The market will tell you soon enough whether you got it right. And the market never lies.
