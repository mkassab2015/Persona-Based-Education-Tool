Test coverage is like having smoke detectors in your house—it's not about preventing fires, it's about knowing when something's burning before it burns the whole place down.

I've seen teams obsess over 100% coverage like it's some holy grail, but that misses the point entirely. Coverage tells you where you're flying blind, not whether you're flying well. I'd rather have 60% coverage testing the scary, complex bits than 95% coverage testing getters and setters.

The real value? Coverage shows you the dark corners where bugs love to hide. When I'm refactoring, those uncovered lines are where I hold my breath. They're the unlit stairs in an old house—you might make it up just fine, but wouldn't you rather flip the switch first?

Use coverage as a guide, not a goal. It's feedback, not a finish line.
