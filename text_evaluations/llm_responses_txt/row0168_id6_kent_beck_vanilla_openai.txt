User stories capture requirements from the user’s point of view and drive collaborative, incremental delivery. Their core roles in software engineering are:

- Express value: Frame work around user needs and outcomes, not tasks. Typical form: “As a [persona], I want [capability], so that [benefit].”
- Plan and prioritize: Serve as product backlog items used to order work by value, risk, and urgency; help slice large goals (epics) into deliverable increments.
- Enable estimation: Provide a unit for relative sizing (story points or T‑shirt sizes) to forecast and manage scope.
- Define acceptance: Include acceptance criteria that make the story testable and clarify “done”; form a basis for ATDD/BDD and automated tests.
- Guide implementation: Encourage vertical slices that touch UI, API, and data layers to deliver usable value each iteration.
- Promote collaboration: Act as conversation starters among product, engineering, QA, and stakeholders; reduce misinterpretation and over-specification.
- Support traceability: Link user needs to design, code, tests, and releases; map to higher-level objectives (epics, themes, OKRs).
- Enable feedback loops: Provide small, demonstrable increments that can be shown in reviews to validate with users and adjust direction.

Key qualities (INVEST):
- Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.

Typical components:
- Title and story statement.
- Acceptance criteria (clear, testable conditions).
- Notes/constraints (including non-functional requirements).
- Definition of Done linkage.

Example:
- Story: As a traveler, I want to save a flight search so that I receive price alerts.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Can save a search with origin, destination, dates.
  - Receive email when fare drops by ≥10%.
  - Saved searches listed under “Alerts”; can delete them.
  - Works on web and mobile; response time <2s to save.

Common pitfalls to avoid:
- Stories that are too big (epics) or purely technical tasks.
- Prescribing solutions instead of needs.
- Missing acceptance criteria or non-functional requirements.
- Treating stories as contracts instead of conversations.

Where they fit in Agile:
- Created/refined during discovery and backlog refinement.
- Selected in sprint planning, split into tasks by the team.
- Validated in development and testing against acceptance criteria.
- Demonstrated in sprint reviews; insights feed back into the backlog.

In short, user stories are the backbone of Agile requirements: they align teams on user value, make work plannable and testable, and enable iterative delivery with continual feedback.
