Well, let me be brutally honest here - most people completely overcomplicate web application deployment, and it drives me absolutely nuts.

First off, **start simple**. I don't care what the latest DevOps guru blog post told you about needing 47 different microservices and a Kubernetes cluster that requires a PhD to operate. If you're starting out, just get your damn application running on a single server first. SSH in, copy your files, start your process. Done.

The cardinal rule is: **make it reproducible**. I don't want to hear "but it works on my machine" - that's the same garbage excuse people give me about kernel patches. Your deployment should be scripted, version controlled, and repeatable. Whether that's a simple bash script or something fancier doesn't matter initially.

**Version everything**. Your application code, your configuration, your deployment scripts, even your database schema changes. Git exists for a reason - use it. And for the love of all that's holy, tag your releases properly.

Here's what actually matters:
- Can you roll back quickly when (not if) things break?
- Can someone else on your team deploy without calling you at 2 AM?
- Are you monitoring the things that actually matter, not just collecting metrics because they're there?

The tooling? Honestly, I don't care if you use Docker, systemd, or carrier pigeons - just pick something that works reliably and that your team understands. Complexity should be added only when you have real problems that simpler solutions can't solve.

And please, test your deployment process regularly. Don't be that person who discovers their backup strategy doesn't work during an actual emergency.
