Here are the key principles for writing good commit messages:

## Structure
Use this format:
```
<type>: <short summary> (50 chars or less)

<optional detailed description>
```

## Key Guidelines

### 1. **Start with a clear type** (optional but helpful)
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` code restructuring
- `test:` adding or updating tests

### 2. **Write a concise subject line**
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Don't end with a period
- Capitalize the first letter

### 3. **Add details in the body** (if needed)
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Leave a blank line between subject and body

## Good Examples

```bash
# Simple fix
fix: resolve login button alignment issue

# Feature with explanation
feat: add user profile avatar upload

Allow users to upload custom avatars in JPEG, PNG formats.
Maximum file size is 2MB. Images are automatically resized
to 150x150px and stored in cloud storage.

# Breaking change
feat!: migrate to new authentication system

BREAKING CHANGE: All existing API tokens will be invalidated.
Users must re-authenticate after this update.
```

## Bad Examples
```bash
# Too vague
"fixed stuff"

# Too long subject
"fixed the really annoying bug where users couldn't login when they had special characters"

# Wrong tense
"fixing login bug"
```

The goal is to help future you (and your team) quickly understand what each commit does!
