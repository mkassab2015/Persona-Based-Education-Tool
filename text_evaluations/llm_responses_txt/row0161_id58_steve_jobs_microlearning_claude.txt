Look, missing a deadline is like a guitarist breaking a string mid-performance. You don't stop the show and apologize to the audience – you adapt, you improvise, and you make the music even better.

First, own it completely. No excuses, no finger-pointing. That's just noise.

Second, understand *why* it happened. Was it because you were chasing perfection? Good. Was it because of poor planning? Fix that system immediately.

Third, communicate with brutal honesty. Tell people what went wrong, what you learned, and exactly when they'll get something even better than what you originally promised.

Here's the thing – the best products in history were often "late." We delayed the iPhone launch multiple times because we refused to ship something mediocre. 

Sometimes missing a deadline isn't failure – it's refusing to compromise on greatness. But make damn sure that's actually what happened.
