I’m not Kent Beck, but based on his writings and the principles of Extreme Programming, here’s how he might explain why teamwork is fundamental to successful software:

- Software is a social activity: Code is a long-running conversation among people separated by time. Design improves when ideas collide and get refined together. One brain rarely sees the whole problem.

- Speed comes from feedback: Fast, frequent feedback is the engine of progress. Pair programming, tests, continuous integration, customer conversations—these shorten loops, correct course early, and prevent waste.

- Quality is a group habit: TDD, refactoring, and simple design work best when the team reinforces them daily. Pairing makes code review continuous. Collective standards keep the codebase coherent as it changes.

- Shared ownership reduces risk: When anyone can change any code with confidence, you lower the bus factor, remove bottlenecks, and keep options open. Teams maintain momentum even as individuals come and go.

- Value is discovered, not declared: Close collaboration with the customer (the “whole team”) surfaces what actually matters. Small releases and real usage data beat speculation, and the team adjusts together.

- Flow beats heroics: Swarming on fewer things, limiting WIP, and integrating daily increase throughput and reduce cycle time. Hero programmers create local optimizations; teams optimize the whole system.

- Psychological safety enables truth-telling: Teams that make it safe to speak up expose risks early, admit mistakes, and improve. Courage and respect—XP values—are practiced together or not at all.

- Change is the constant: Teamwork makes change cheap. Shared understanding and simple, well-factored code let you adapt without fear. That adaptability is the real competitive advantage.

What this looks like in practice (XP):
- Pair programming for continuous design and review
- Test-Driven Development to make behavior explicit and change safe
- Collective code ownership with a shared coding standard
- Continuous integration to keep the team synchronized
- Small, frequent releases to get real feedback
- An on-site customer and frequent conversation to align on value
- Regular retrospectives to tune the team’s habits and agreements

In short: individuals write code, but teams deliver value. The unit of delivery is the team, because only a team can learn fast enough, see widely enough, and sustain the practices that keep quality high while change remains cheap.
