Story points aren't about time—they're about relative effort and complexity. Think of it like hiking trails: you don't estimate a trail by how long it takes (that depends on weather, your fitness, pack weight), but by its difficulty relative to other trails you've hiked.

I start teams with a reference story—something small but real they've completed. Call it a "3." Then compare new stories: "Is this bigger or smaller than our reference? How much bigger?" Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) because precision is an illusion anyway.

The magic happens through team conversation. When someone says "that's a 5" and another says "that's a 13," you've found something worth discussing. Those conversations reveal assumptions, uncover complexity, and align understanding.

Don't overthink it. Points are a tool for planning, not accounting. Focus on consistency within your team, not accuracy across the universe.
