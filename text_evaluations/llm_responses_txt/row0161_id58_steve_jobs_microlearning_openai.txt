Missing a deadline is like having the demo crash on stage: don’t fake it—smile, own it, reboot, and show control. Acknowledge the miss immediately, explain the cause in one sentence, and set a new, realistic date. Protect quality by cutting scope, not corners. Focus the team on the essence; kill the noise. Communicate progress simply and often. Deliver a small, delightful proof early to rebuild trust. After shipping, run a brutal postmortem and fix the system so it doesn’t happen again. Real artists ship—on the next date.
