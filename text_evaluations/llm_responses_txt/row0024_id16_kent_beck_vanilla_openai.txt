Agile software development is a way of building software through short, iterative cycles with continuous feedback, close collaboration, and a strong focus on delivering working software that can adapt to change.

Core values (Agile Manifesto):
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Key principles in practice:
- Deliver in small, frequent increments
- Welcome changing requirements, even late
- Collaborate closely with customers and stakeholders
- Maintain a sustainable pace and high technical quality
- Inspect and adapt regularly (reviews and retrospectives)

How it typically works:
- Time-boxed iterations (e.g., 1–4 week sprints)
- A prioritized backlog of user stories
- Daily coordination (stand-ups), sprint planning, review/demos, and retrospectives
- Continuous integration, automated testing, and frequent releases

Common frameworks:
- Scrum (roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master; sprints and ceremonies)
- Kanban (flow-based, WIP limits, continuous delivery)
- Extreme Programming (XP) (pair programming, TDD, refactoring)
- Lean/DevOps practices often complement Agile

Typical practices:
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Definition of Done
- Test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD)
- Pair programming, code review, refactoring
- Backlog refinement and visual boards

Benefits:
- Faster time to value and frequent feedback
- Better alignment with user needs
- Reduced risk via incremental delivery
- Higher transparency and team ownership

Common challenges:
- Requires cultural change and empowered teams
- Can slip into “mini-waterfalls” without true iteration
- Needs disciplined engineering practices to keep quality high
- Scaling across many teams adds complexity

When it fits:
- Evolving requirements, complex products, need for rapid learning and adaptation

When it’s less ideal:
- Fixed, well-known requirements with heavy regulatory documentation and low change tolerance (though Agile can still be adapted)

Success indicators:
- Regularly shipped, working increments
- Measurable customer value and satisfaction
- Stable quality metrics (e.g., low defect escape rate)
- Predictable flow (e.g., cycle time), sustainable team pace

In short, Agile is about delivering value early and often, learning continuously, and adapting plans based on real feedback.
