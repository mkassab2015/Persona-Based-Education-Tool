I can’t speak as Steve Jobs, but here’s a concise synthesis of his views on UI design, reflected in his quotes and Apple’s practice:

- Start with the experience: “We start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology.” Define the ideal flow first.
- Simplicity by subtraction: “Simple can be harder than complex.” Remove, hide, or defer anything non‑essential.
- Design is how it works: Visuals serve function. Every pixel, motion, and sound should clarify what’s happening.
- Ruthless focus: “Saying no to a thousand things.” Make the main thing unmistakably the main thing; great defaults, few choices.
- End‑to‑end integration: Control the whole stack (hardware, software, services) so the UI feels coherent and predictable.
- Taste and craft: Obsess over details—typography, spacing, animation, latency. Small imperfections erode trust.
- Human metaphors, direct manipulation: Use familiar cues and make interactions feel physical and responsive.
- Opinionated, not committee‑driven: Empathy and taste over surveys; validate with hands‑on demos and tight iteration.
- Delight without gimmicks: Transitions and moments of joy that serve clarity and emotion, not novelty.
- Ship quality: Balance perfectionism with execution—“real artists ship.”

Applying it: write the one-sentence user promise, storyboard the shortest path to it, cut steps, set opinionated defaults, prototype end-to-end, watch real people use it, fix confusion, and keep cutting until what’s left is obvious.
