Don't waste a second on excuses. Own it. Instantly. The past is irrelevant. The only thing that matters now is the product and the new path forward.

Think of it like a master craftsman who discovers a flaw in a perfect piece of wood. He doesn’t just patch it and ship it. He re-imagines the entire design to make that “flaw” the most stunning and intentional feature of the piece.

This delay is now part of your story. Don’t just fix the problem; use this moment to re-examine everything and deliver something so insanely great, people will forget you were ever late. Now get back to work.
