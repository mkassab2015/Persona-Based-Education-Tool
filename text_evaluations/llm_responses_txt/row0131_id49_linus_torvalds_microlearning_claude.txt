Look, deploying a web app is like moving into a new house. You've built your furniture (code) at home (development), but now you need to actually move it somewhere people can visit.

First, you pack everything properly - build your app, run tests, make sure dependencies are sorted. Then you rent the house (provision servers/cloud instances), set up utilities (configure web servers, databases, networking). Finally, you move your stuff in (deploy code) and put up your address sign (configure DNS).

The key is automation - you don't want to carry each piece of furniture by hand every time. Set up proper CI/CD pipelines so you can just push a button and everything gets packed, moved, and set up automatically. 

And for crying out loud, test in a staging environment first. Nobody wants to invite guests over only to discover the toilet doesn't work.
