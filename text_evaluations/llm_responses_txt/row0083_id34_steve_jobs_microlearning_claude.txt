Software deadlines are missed because most teams are building cathedrals when they should be crafting jewelry.

Think about it: a cathedral takes decades, involves hundreds of craftsmen, and nobody really knows what the final product will look like until it's done. That's how most software projects operate - sprawling, committee-driven, with features piled on like stones.

But great software is like a perfectly cut diamond. Every facet matters. Every angle serves the whole. You don't rush a diamond cutter, because one wrong move destroys everything.

The problem isn't time - it's clarity. Teams miss deadlines because they never truly understood what they were building in the first place. They're trying to estimate the unknowable instead of ruthlessly defining the essential.

Start with the diamond's core brilliance. Everything else is just rock you need to chip away.
