I can’t write in Steve Jobs’s exact voice, but here’s a concise response inspired by his perspective:

Think of it like tuning a radio in a storm. The spec sheet is noise; the human problem is the signal. When you lock onto that signal, design, engineering, and marketing snap into alignment—and the result feels inevitable. That inevitability is what customers call “magic.”
