Short answer: to reduce risk, improve quality, and build shared understanding.

Why code reviews help:
- Catch defects early: logic errors, edge cases, regressions are cheaper to fix before merge.
- Improve design: sanity-check architecture, APIs, performance, scalability, failure modes.
- Strengthen security and privacy: spot injection risks, auth/crypto mistakes, secret handling, compliance gaps.
- Ensure test quality: verify coverage, meaningful assertions, and that tests reflect requirements.
- Improve readability and consistency: clearer names, simpler code, consistent patterns; easier maintenance later.
- Spread knowledge: reduce bus-factor, onboard teammates, share domain context and tacit practices.
- Create shared ownership and accountability: raise the bar, align on standards, avoid “only X can change this.”
- Provide traceability: documented rationale and approvals for audits and future debugging.
- Build a feedback culture: mentoring and continuous improvement.

Make them effective (and not slow):
- Keep changes small and focused; automate style with linters/formatters.
- Provide context in the PR (problem, approach, risks).
- Use checklists (correctness, tests, security, failure modes, migrations, docs).
- Set review SLAs and rotate reviewers; pair/mob for high-risk work.
- Skip or streamline for trivial, generated, or docs-only changes, or when pair-programming already provided review.

If you want, tell me your team’s size, repo setup, and pain points, and I can suggest a lightweight review process and checklist.
