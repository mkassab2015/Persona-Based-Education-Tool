Look, a commit message is like a medical chart for your codebase. When something breaks at 3am six months from now, you don't want to be playing detective trying to figure out what the hell past-you was thinking.

First line: 50 characters max, imperative mood. "Fix memory leak in driver initialization" not "Fixed a bug." Think of it as the subject line that makes someone want to read the email.

Then a blank line, then explain the *why*, not the what. The diff shows what changed. Your message should explain why it was broken and why your fix makes sense.

If you can't explain your change clearly in a commit message, you probably don't understand it well enough yourself. And if future maintainers can't understand your reasoning, your brilliant code becomes tomorrow's "git blame" target of frustration.

Write for the poor bastard who has to debug this later. That poor bastard might be you.
