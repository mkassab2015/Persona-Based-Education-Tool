Here are the key differences between procedural and object-oriented programming:

## **Procedural Programming**

**Structure:**
- Code is organized as a collection of functions or procedures
- Data and functions are separate entities
- Follows a top-down approach

**Key Characteristics:**
- Functions operate on global data or data passed as parameters
- Program execution follows a linear sequence of function calls
- Focus is on "what needs to be done" (the procedures)

**Example (C):**
```c
// Data structures
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float gpa;
};

// Functions that operate on the data
void printStudent(struct Student s) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, GPA: %.2f\n", s.name, s.age, s.gpa);
}

float calculateAverage(struct Student students[], int count) {
    // calculation logic
}
```

## **Object-Oriented Programming**

**Structure:**
- Code is organized into classes and objects
- Data (attributes) and functions (methods) are bundled together
- Follows a bottom-up approach

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Encapsulation:** Data and methods are contained within objects
- **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit properties from other classes
- **Polymorphism:** Objects can take multiple forms
- **Abstraction:** Complex implementations are hidden behind simple interfaces

**Example (Java):**
```java
class Student {
    // Data (attributes)
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private float gpa;
    
    // Methods that operate on the object's data
    public void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", GPA: " + gpa);
    }
    
    public float getGPA() {
        return this.gpa;
    }
}
```

## **Main Differences Summary**

| Aspect | Procedural | Object-Oriented |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Functions and procedures | Objects and classes |
| **Data Security** | Less secure (global data) | More secure (encapsulation) |
