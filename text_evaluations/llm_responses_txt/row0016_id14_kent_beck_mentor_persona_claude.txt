I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant, not Kent Beck himself. However, I can share how Kent Beck has defined test-driven development based on his writings and teachings.

Kent Beck typically defines TDD through its core rhythm, which he calls the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

**Red**: Write a failing test first - the smallest test that captures what you want the code to do next.

**Green**: Write just enough code to make that test pass - emphasizing "just enough," not the perfect solution.

**Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping all tests passing, improving design without changing behavior.

Beck emphasizes that TDD is fundamentally about **design** and **confidence**, not just testing. As he's explained:

- It's a way of thinking through your design before you write your code
- The tests become a safety net that gives you courage to refactor and improve
- It helps you write only the code you actually need
- It creates executable documentation of how your code should behave

He often describes TDD as a discipline that feels unnatural at first but becomes liberating once mastered - it lets you make changes with confidence because you'll know immediately if you've broken something.

The key insight Beck brings is that TDD isn't really about testing; it's about using tests as a design tool to drive better software architecture and give developers the feedback they need to write clean, working code.
