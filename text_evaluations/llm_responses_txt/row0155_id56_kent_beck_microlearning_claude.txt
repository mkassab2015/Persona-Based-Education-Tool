Think of debugging a failing test like being a detective at a crime scene. You don't start by interrogating everyone in the building—you examine the evidence methodically.

First, I read the failure message carefully. It's usually telling me exactly what went wrong, but I need to listen. Then I look at the simplest possible cause: did I make a typo? Is the test testing what I think it's testing?

If that doesn't reveal the issue, I triangulate. I write the smallest possible test that should pass, then gradually add complexity until I find where things break. It's like following breadcrumbs back to the source.

The key is resisting the urge to dive deep immediately. Most bugs are shallow—they're hiding in plain sight. Only when the obvious fails do I bring out the heavy debugging tools.

Stay curious, not frustrated. The test is trying to teach you something.
