The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that development teams use to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It provides a systematic approach to software creation that helps ensure quality, efficiency, and successful project completion.

## Key Phases of SDLC

### 1. **Planning & Requirements Analysis**
- Define project scope and objectives
- Gather and analyze business requirements
- Assess feasibility and resources
- Create project timeline and budget

### 2. **System Design**
- Create system architecture
- Design user interfaces and databases
- Define technical specifications
- Plan system integration approaches

### 3. **Implementation/Development**
- Write code based on design specifications
- Develop individual components and modules
- Integrate different parts of the system
- Follow coding standards and best practices

### 4. **Testing**
- Unit testing of individual components
- Integration testing of combined modules
- System testing of the complete application
- User acceptance testing (UAT)

### 5. **Deployment**
- Release software to production environment
- Install and configure the system
- Provide user training and documentation
- Monitor initial system performance

### 6. **Maintenance**
- Fix bugs and issues
- Implement updates and enhancements
- Provide ongoing technical support
- Monitor system performance and security

## Common SDLC Models

- **Waterfall**: Sequential, linear approach
- **Agile**: Iterative, flexible development
- **Scrum**: Sprint-based Agile framework
- **DevOps**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **V-Model**: Testing-focused approach

The SDLC helps teams deliver reliable software on time and within budget while meeting user requirements.
