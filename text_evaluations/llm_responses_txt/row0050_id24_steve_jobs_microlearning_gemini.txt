Some people think this is about features or specs. They’re wrong. It’s about starting with the user experience and working backwards. You have to care enough to understand their needs on a profound level—often, needs they can't even articulate.

A user’s need is a locked door. Most companies just hand you a big, messy keyring and hope one of the keys works. We craft a single, elegant key. It slides in, turns without a thought, and opens a door to something wonderful.

They don't admire the key; they're captivated by the new room they've just entered. That’s everything.
