Here's a comprehensive guide to managing version control conflicts:

## Understanding Conflicts

Version control conflicts occur when:
- Multiple people edit the same lines of code
- One person deletes a file while another modifies it
- Branches have divergent changes that can't be automatically merged

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Communication & Workflow
```bash
# Pull frequently to stay updated
git pull origin main

# Use feature branches
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Keep branches short-lived
# Merge/rebase frequently
```

### 2. File Organization
- Avoid editing the same files simultaneously
- Break large files into smaller, focused modules
- Use clear naming conventions

## Resolving Git Conflicts

### 1. Identify Conflicts
```bash
# After a failed merge
git status

# Shows conflicted files marked as "both modified"
```

### 2. Examine Conflict Markers
```python
# Example conflicted file
def calculate_total(items):
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Your changes
    total = sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)
    return total * 1.08  # Add tax
=======
    # Incoming changes
    subtotal = 0
    for item in items:
        subtotal += item.price * item.quantity
    return subtotal
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

### 3. Resolution Methods

**Manual Resolution:**
```bash
# Edit the file to resolve conflicts
# Remove conflict markers
# Keep desired changes

# Mark as resolved
git add conflicted-file.py

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

**Using Merge Tools:**
```bash
# Configure merge tool
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
# or: vscode, meld, kdiff3, etc.

# Launch merge tool
git mergetool
```

## Advanced Conflict Resolution

### 1. Interactive Rebase
```bash
# Rebase with conflict resolution
git rebase -i main

# During conflicts:
git add resolved-files
git rebase --continue

# Abort if needed
git rebase --abort
```

### 2. Cherry-pick Conflicts
```bash
# When cherry-picking causes conflicts
git cherry
