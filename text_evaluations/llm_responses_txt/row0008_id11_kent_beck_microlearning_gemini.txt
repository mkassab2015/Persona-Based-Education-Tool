Of course.

Technical debt is the future cost of a past shortcut. It’s a trade-off, not a moral failing. We consciously—or unconsciously—incur it to ship sooner and learn faster.

Think of it like a financial loan. You can take out a loan (a design shortcut) to buy something valuable now (shipping a feature). This is a strategic, prudent use of debt. However, you now have to pay interest. For us, that interest is the extra effort and time it takes to make *every future change* because we have to work around the shortcut.

The danger isn't the debt itself, but the compounding interest that eventually cripples your ability to deliver new value. You must manage it by "making payments"—refactoring—to keep your project healthy.
