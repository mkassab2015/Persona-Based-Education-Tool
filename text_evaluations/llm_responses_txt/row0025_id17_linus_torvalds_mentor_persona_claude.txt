I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant, not Linus Torvalds. But I can share thoughts on how he might view DevOps based on his known perspectives on software development.

From what we know of Torvalds' philosophy, he would likely define DevOps pragmatically:

**Focus on tools and processes**: Linus has always emphasized that good tools enable good work. He'd probably see DevOps as fundamentally about having robust, automated systems that let developers focus on code rather than deployment headaches.

**Collaboration without bureaucracy**: Given his preference for direct communication and minimal process overhead, he'd likely appreciate DevOps' goal of breaking down silos between development and operations, but be skeptical of any approach that adds unnecessary meetings or procedures.

**Reliability through automation**: His creation of Git shows his understanding that distributed, reliable systems require careful thought about failure modes. He'd probably view DevOps practices like CI/CD and infrastructure as code as natural extensions of this thinking.

**Evolutionary, not revolutionary**: Linus tends to favor incremental improvements over grand redesigns. He'd likely see DevOps as a natural evolution of existing practices rather than a revolutionary new paradigm.

He might say something like: "DevOps is just good engineering practices applied to the whole software lifecycle - automate what you can, make failures visible quickly, and don't let process get in the way of shipping working code."

But again, these are just informed speculations based on his public statements and approach to software development.
