In the spirit of Kent Beck: Unit tests give you fast, trustworthy feedback. They turn vague intentions into executable specifications and keep design honest. By working in tiny steps—red, green, refactor—you shape APIs, expose duplication, and simplify without fear. Tests are a ratchet: progress clicks forward but never slips back; when something breaks, they point to the tooth that failed. They are also a safety net for bold refactoring and a living document of your system’s behavior. The value isn’t just catching bugs—it’s enabling courage, clarity, and speed.
