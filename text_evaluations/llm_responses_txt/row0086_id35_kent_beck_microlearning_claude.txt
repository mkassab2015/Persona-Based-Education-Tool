The core reason for agile's popularity is that it acknowledges a fundamental truth about software development: we can't predict the future, but we can respond to it quickly.

Traditional software development was like trying to build a house by drawing detailed blueprints for every room before laying the foundation. If the family's needs changed halfway through construction, you were stuck with expensive change orders or a house that didn't fit.

Agile is more like renovating while you live in the house. You make one room better, see how it works for the family, learn from that experience, then tackle the next room. Each improvement is small, quick, and based on real feedback rather than guesses.

This resonates because software exists in a world of constant change—user needs evolve, technology advances, markets shift. Agile embraces this uncertainty rather than fighting it, making teams more responsive and ultimately more successful.
