Here's a step-by-step guide to conducting a usability test:

## 1. Planning Phase

**Define objectives:**
- What specific aspects do you want to test?
- What questions need answering?
- What success metrics will you use?

**Choose your method:**
- **Moderated vs. unmoderated** (guided vs. independent)
- **Remote vs. in-person**
- **Qualitative vs. quantitative** focus

## 2. Preparation

**Recruit participants:**
- 5-8 users typically sufficient for most tests
- Match your target audience demographics
- Screen participants to ensure relevance

**Create test materials:**
- Task scenarios (realistic, specific goals)
- Pre/post-test questionnaires
- Consent forms
- Recording setup (if applicable)

## 3. During the Test

**Set the environment:**
- Make participants comfortable
- Explain the process and get consent
- Emphasize testing the product, not them

**Facilitate effectively:**
- Give clear task instructions
- Use think-aloud protocol ("Tell me what you're thinking")
- Observe without interfering
- Ask follow-up questions: "What did you expect to happen?"

## 4. Analysis & Reporting

**Document findings:**
- Note usability issues and their severity
- Identify patterns across participants
- Capture direct quotes
- Prioritize problems by frequency and impact

**Create actionable recommendations:**
- Specific solutions, not just problems
- Consider feasibility and resources
- Present findings clearly to stakeholders
