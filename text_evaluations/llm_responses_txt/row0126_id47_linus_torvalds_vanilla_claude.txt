Here's a comprehensive guide to running effective code reviews:

## Setting Up Code Reviews

### 1. Choose Your Tools
- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**: Built-in pull/merge request reviews
- **Azure DevOps**: Pull request reviews
- **Crucible, Review Board**: Dedicated review tools
- **IDE plugins**: For lightweight reviews

### 2. Establish Review Policies
```yaml
# Example branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require at least 2 reviewers
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Require review from code owners
- Require status checks to pass
```

## Review Process

### 1. Pre-Review Checklist (Author)
- [ ] Code compiles and tests pass
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Clear, descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Pull request description explains changes
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated

### 2. Review Guidelines

**What to Look For:**
- **Functionality**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- **Logic errors**: Edge cases, null checks, boundary conditions
- **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Style**: Consistent with team standards
- **Maintainability**: Clear, readable, well-structured code
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage

**Review Priorities (in order):**
1. Correctness and security issues
2. Design and architecture concerns
3. Performance problems
4. Code style and formatting

### 3. Providing Feedback

**Good Review Comments:**
```
// ✅ Specific and actionable
"Consider using a Set instead of Array here for O(1) lookup 
instead of O(n) - this could impact performance with large datasets"

// ✅ Explains the why
"This function is doing too many things. Consider splitting 
the validation logic into a separate function for better testability"

// ✅ Suggests alternatives
"Instead of nested if statements, consider using early returns 
to reduce complexity"
```

**Avoid:**
```
// ❌ Vague
"This looks wrong"

// ❌ Personal preference
