Alright, pull up a chair. You want to know how to write a plan before you start wrestling with the machine. Good. That's the most important step, and it’s the one most people are in a hurry to skip.

Back when we were working with the Mark I, we didn't have the luxury of fancy languages. We had switches, and plugboards, and raw machine instructions. If you made a logical error, you might not find it for days. We learned the hard way: you had better have your thinking straight *before* you commit to a single line of code.

Think of it like building a ship. You don't just start welding steel plates together and hope a cruiser comes out the other end. You start with a blueprint. You draw every bulkhead, every wire, every pipe. You make sure the engine room actually connects to the propeller shaft *on paper* first. That blueprint is your pseudocode. It's a tool for thinking and for communicating.

So, here's how I see it. My guide to writing a proper blueprint for your programs.

### 1. Speak Plain English, Not Gibberish

This was the whole point of COBOL. We wanted to write instructions in a language that people could read. Your pseudocode is for *you* and your fellow humans, not for the computer. The machine is a glorified, high-speed idiot; it will do exactly what you tell it. The hard part is telling it the right thing.

So, write it out in clear, simple, unambiguous English. Forget about semicolons and curly braces. Think about commands.

*   Instead of `let x = document.getElementById("userInput").value;`
*   Write: `GET the user's name FROM the input box`

Anyone on your team, even the new ensign who just came aboard, should be able to read your pseudocode and understand the *intent* of your program.

### 2. Focus on the Logic, Not the Syntax

This is where young people get tangled up. They start worrying about whether to use a `for` loop or a `while` loop or what the exact syntax for a function call is in Python versus Java.

Stop. That's detail work. That's picking out the rivets for the ship. Right now, you're the architect. You need to decide *what* happens, in *what order*, and *when*.

Use keywords that describe the logical flow. Keep them consistent.

*   **SEQUENCE:** Write steps in the order they happen.
*   **SELECTION:** Use `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `ENDIF` for decisions. "IF the fuel tank is empty, THEN sound the alarm, ELSE continue normal operations."
*   **ITERATION:** Use `WHILE` or `FOR` for loops. "WHILE there are still records in the logbook, DO the following..." or "FOR each sailor on the duty roster..."

### 3. Indent Like a Commanding Officer

Your logic has a chain of command. Some instructions are subordinate to others. An action inside an `IF` statement only happens if that condition is true. It works for the `IF`.

Show that relationship with indentation. It's not for the computer; it's for your brain. It makes the structure of your logic immediately obvious.

**Look at this mess:**
`IF user is valid THEN`
`DISPLAY welcome message`
`GET user's records`
`FOR each record`
`DISPLAY record summary`
`END FOR`
`ELSE`
`DISPLAY error message`
`ENDIF`

**Now, look at the blueprint:**

```
IF the user is valid THEN
    DISPLAY the welcome message
    GET the user's records from the database
    FOR each record in the user's records
        DISPLAY a summary of the record
    END FOR
ELSE
    DISPLAY an "access denied" error message
ENDIF
```
See? You can immediately see the structure. You know exactly what's inside the `IF` and what's inside the `FOR` loop. It's clean. It's disciplined.

### An Example: The Coffee Pot Problem

Let's say our task is simple: check if there's coffee. If there is, pour a cup. If not, make a new pot.

Here's my pseudocode for that:

```
PROCEDURE: Get_A_Cup_Of_Coffee

  START

    // Check the status of the pot
    GET the status of the coffee pot.

    IF the pot is empty THEN
        // If it's empty, we have to make more
        DISPLAY "The pot is empty. Making a new one."
        EXECUTE the procedure "Make_New_Pot_Of_Coffee"
        POUR a cup of coffee.
    ELSE
        // If it's not empty, just pour
        POUR a cup of coffee.
        DISPLAY "Enjoy your coffee."
    ENDIF

  END
```
Notice a few things. I gave the whole process a name (`Get_A_Cup_Of_Coffee`). I broke a complex step (`Make_New_Pot_Of_Coffee`) into its own procedure, which I'd define elsewhere. It's written in plain English. The logic is crystal clear because of the keywords and indentation.

Remember, the goal of pseudocode isn't to be "correct" in a programming language sense. Its goal is to be **clear**. It’s your chance to find the logical bugs—the flaws in your thinking—before you've wasted hours writing code that was doomed from the start.

You debug your *thinking* with pseudocode. You debug your *typing* with a compiler. The first one is a lot cheaper and faster.

Now, stop asking and start planning. You've got work to do. Dismissed.
