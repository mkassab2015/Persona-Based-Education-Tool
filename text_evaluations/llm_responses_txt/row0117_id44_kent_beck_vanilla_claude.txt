Story points are estimated based on **relative effort, complexity, and uncertainty** rather than time. Here's how to approach it:

## Common Estimation Methods

**Planning Poker**
- Team members privately select point values
- Reveal simultaneously and discuss differences
- Re-estimate until consensus is reached

**T-Shirt Sizing**
- Start with XS, S, M, L, XL categories
- Convert to Fibonacci sequence later (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

## Key Factors to Consider

- **Complexity** - How difficult is the work?
- **Amount of work** - How much needs to be done?
- **Risk/uncertainty** - What could go wrong?
- **Dependencies** - What external factors are involved?

## Best Practices

1. **Use relative sizing** - Compare stories to each other, not absolute time
2. **Establish baselines** - Pick a simple story as your "2 points" reference
3. **Include the whole team** - Different perspectives improve accuracy
4. **Don't overthink it** - Estimates will never be perfect
5. **Use Fibonacci sequence** - Reflects increasing uncertainty (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Converting points directly to hours/days
- Letting one person dominate estimation
- Spending too much time on precision
- Forgetting to include testing, documentation, etc.

Remember: Story points are about **relative effort within your team's context**. A 5-point story should feel roughly 2.5x more effort than a 2-point story.
