Technical debt is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easier, quicker, or less optimal technical solution now instead of a better, more sustainable one. Like financial debt, it can be strategic, but it accrues “interest”: extra effort, risk, and complexity that make future changes slower and more expensive.

Key points:
- Common causes: time pressure, incomplete tests, quick fixes, outdated dependencies, poor architecture, copy-paste code, missing docs, skipped reviews.
- Types:
  - Code and design (architecture shortcuts, tight coupling, code smells)
  - Testing and quality (low coverage, flaky tests)
  - Build/CI/CD and tooling (manual releases, brittle pipelines)
  - Dependencies and platforms (obsolete libraries, unsupported runtimes)
  - Data and schema (denormalized or inconsistent data models)
  - Security and infrastructure (hardcoded secrets, ad‑hoc configs)
  - Documentation and knowledge gaps
- Consequences: slower delivery, more defects, harder onboarding, higher incident rates, brittle systems, rising maintenance costs.
- Not the same as bugs: a bug is incorrect behavior; tech debt is a quality/maintainability deficiency that makes change harder (though it can lead to bugs).
- When it’s rational: to hit a market window, run experiments, or de-risk unknowns—if you plan how to pay it back.

How to manage it:
- Make it visible: track in a “debt register,” tag issues, quantify impact (“interest rate”: how much time it costs per sprint).
- Prioritize by cost of delay and risk; fix high-interest items first.
- Repay continuously: refactor in small increments, add/strengthen tests, update dependencies, improve observability, reduce coupling.
- Guardrails: code reviews, CI, linters, Definition of Done including tests/docs, architectural guidelines.
- Metrics to watch: lead time for changes, change failure rate, MTTR, defect trends, code complexity, dependency freshness, test coverage.

In short, technical debt is a trade-off. Use it deliberately, measure its interest, and pay it down regularly.
