Of course.

People mistake user stories for tiny requirement documents. They aren't. A story is a promise for a conversation. Its purpose is to articulate a user's need and to invite the team—developers, customers, testers—to collaborate on the best way to satisfy that need. It's about building a shared understanding.

Think of a story as a **travel postcard from the future**. It has a picture of a desirable destination (the user's goal) and a short message ("Wish you could do X..."). It doesn't provide the turn-by-turn directions to get there. The team discovers the best route together through conversation, collaboration, and building the software.

This shifts the focus from writing specifications to having valuable conversations, which is the heart of agility.
