Continuous integration (CI) means merging code to a shared branch frequently and automatically building and testing it each time. It’s a good practice because it reduces risk while increasing speed and quality.

Key benefits
- Catches problems early: Integration, compilation, and test failures are found minutes after a change, not days or weeks later.
- Smaller, safer changes: Frequent merges keep diffs small, making bugs easier to locate and fixes easier to ship or roll back.
- Fewer merge conflicts: Short-lived branches reduce “integration hell.”
- Faster feedback for developers: Quick pass/fail signals keep engineers in flow and productive.
- Consistent, reproducible builds: Automated, scripted builds reduce “works on my machine” issues.
- Higher code quality: Enforces quality gates (tests, linting, formatting, static analysis) on every change.
- Security and compliance early: SAST, dependency scanning, and license checks run continuously.
- Visibility and accountability: Build status and metrics (lead time, failure rate) are transparent to the team.
- Foundation for CD: Reliable CI pipelines make it safe to automate releases later.
- Reduced operational risk and cost: Fewer late-stage surprises and manual steps.

Good CI practices
- Run on every push and pull request; protect main with required checks.
- Keep feedback fast (ideally under 10–15 minutes); parallelize and cache builds.
- Maintain a solid automated test pyramid (unit >> integration >> e2e) and deflake tests.
- Make builds deterministic; pin dependencies; version and store artifacts (“build once, promote”).
- Treat a red build as stop-the-line; fix before adding new changes.
- Scan for security (SAST, dependency, secrets) and enforce coding standards.
- Use ephemeral, production-like environments for integration tests.

Example minimal pipeline
- Checkout and dependency install
- Build and unit tests
- Lint/format and static analysis
- Package artifact and store it
- On main: run integration tests; optionally trigger deploy in CD
