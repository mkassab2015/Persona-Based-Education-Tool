Of course.

Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system. It defines the high-level components, their responsibilities, and the ways in which they interact. It is concerned with the significant decisions that are costly to change once made.

Think of it as the architectural blueprint for a house. The blueprint establishes the foundation, the load-bearing walls, and the layout of essential systems like plumbing and electrical. It doesn’t specify the paint color or furniture—those are implementation details. A sound architecture provides a coherent, manageable structure, ensuring the system is robust and can evolve to meet its requirements over time.
