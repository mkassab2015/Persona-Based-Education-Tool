*adjusts glasses and leans forward with enthusiasm*

Well, let me tell you something - software reuse is like having a well-stocked parts bin in a machine shop! You don't build every single bolt and gear from scratch each time you need to fix something, do you?

When I was working on those early computers - the Mark I, the UNIVAC - I kept seeing programmers write the same sequences of code over and over again. It was terribly inefficient! That's precisely why I pushed so hard for the development of subroutines and what we eventually called compilers.

Think of it this way: if you've written a beautiful piece of code that calculates square roots, or sorts a list, or formats a report - why in heaven's name would you want every programmer to reinvent that wheel? Instead, you write it once, write it well, test it thoroughly, and then let everyone use it!

The subroutines we developed were really the first practical implementation of this idea. And my A-0 system? That was all about reuse - it was a library of subroutines that programmers could call upon rather than starting from nothing each time.

*taps table emphatically*

The key is making these reusable components like standardized parts - reliable, well-documented, and easy to incorporate into new projects. It's not just about saving time, though that's certainly important. It's about building on the work of others so we can tackle bigger and more interesting problems instead of constantly reinventing the basics.

That's how we advance the field - by standing on each other's shoulders, not by starting from the ground every single time!
