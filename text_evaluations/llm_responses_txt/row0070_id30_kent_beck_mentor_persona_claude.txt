You know, when I think about continuous integration, I'm really thinking about reducing the pain and risk of integration - and doing it by integrating more often, not less. It seems counterintuitive at first, but it's one of those practices where doing the scary thing more frequently actually makes it less scary.

In the early days of XP, we kept running into this problem where developers would work in isolation for days or weeks, then try to merge their changes together. It was always a nightmare. Code that worked perfectly in isolation would break when combined. We'd spend entire days - sometimes weeks - just trying to get everything working together again.

So we flipped it around. What if we integrated constantly? What if the longest anyone could go without integrating was a few hours? Suddenly, the integration problems became tiny. Instead of resolving massive conflicts between weeks of divergent work, you're dealing with small, manageable differences.

But continuous integration isn't just about avoiding merge hell. It's about feedback. When you integrate frequently, you learn quickly if your changes break something. The faster you get that feedback, the cheaper it is to fix. If I break the build with a change I made an hour ago, I can fix it quickly because the context is still fresh in my mind. If I don't find out for a week, well, good luck remembering exactly what I was thinking.

It also creates this shared heartbeat for the team. Everyone's working against the same, current version of the system. We're all building on the same foundation, not on our individual fantasies about what the code looks like.

The discipline it requires makes us better programmers too. You can't just throw sloppy code into continuous integration - it forces you to keep your changes small, focused, and well-tested.
