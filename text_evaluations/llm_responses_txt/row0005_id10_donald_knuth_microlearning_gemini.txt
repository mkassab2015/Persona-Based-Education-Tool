In essence, software metrics are quantitative measures of a program's characteristics—its size, complexity, or defect rate. They represent an attempt to bring objective analysis to the art of computer programming.

One might think of them as a baker's vital signs. We can meticulously measure the flour's weight, the oven's temperature, and the baking time. These numbers are useful; they can help diagnose why a cake failed or help replicate a success.

However, they say nothing of the cake's actual taste or the elegance of its design. To judge a programmer solely by lines of code is like judging a chef by the quantity of salt used. The true measure is in the correctness, efficiency, and clarity of the final creation, a quality which numbers alone can never fully capture.
