Of course.

Think of software development not as building a bridge, but as driving a car to a new city.

With the old "waterfall" method, you'd try to print out a perfect, turn-by-turn map for the entire 1,000-mile journey before you even start the engine. It's rigid and can't handle unexpected detours or traffic.

Agile is like using a GPS. You have a destination, but you only focus on the next few turns. You get constant feedback from the road, allowing you to react to traffic jams, discover better routes, or even change your destination if you find a more valuable one along the way.

We work in short cycles, delivering value and getting feedback continuously, so we're always steering toward what's most important *now*. It's about responding to reality, not clinging to a plan.
