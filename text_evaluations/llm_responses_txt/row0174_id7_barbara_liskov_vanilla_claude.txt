Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. This separation helps organize code, improve maintainability, and promote reusability.

## The Three Components

### **Model**
- Represents the data and business logic
- Manages data storage, retrieval, and validation
- Independent of the user interface
- Notifies observers (typically the View) when data changes

### **View**
- Handles the presentation layer (user interface)
- Displays data from the Model to the user
- Receives user input but doesn't process it directly
- Can be multiple views for the same data

### **Controller**
- Acts as an intermediary between Model and View
- Processes user input and requests
- Updates the Model based on user actions
- Selects appropriate Views to display

## How MVC Works

```
User Input → Controller → Model → View → User Interface
     ↑                              ↓
     ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
```

1. User interacts with the View
2. Controller receives and processes the input
3. Controller updates the Model if needed
4. Model notifies View of changes
5. View updates the display

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component minimally affect others
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the application
- **Testability**: Easier to unit test individual components
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different components simultaneously

## Common Examples

- **Web Applications**: Django (Python), Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC
- **Desktop Applications**: Swing (Java), WPF (.NET)
- **Mobile Development**: iOS development often follows MVC patterns

MVC remains one of the most widely used architectural patterns in software development.
