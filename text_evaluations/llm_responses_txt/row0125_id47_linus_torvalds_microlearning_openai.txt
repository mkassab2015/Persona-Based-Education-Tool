Linus Torvalds emphasizes pragmatic, incremental reviews. Send small, self-contained patches that compile, are bisectable, and include clear commit messages explaining the why. Evidence beats opinion: benchmarks and real bug reports matter. Regressions are unacceptable—if something breaks, revert first, discuss later. Avoid large rewrites or cosmetic churn; change code only when it measurably improves correctness, performance, or maintainability. Reviews happen publicly via a maintainer hierarchy; responsibility follows the Signed-off-by chain. Feedback should be blunt and focused on code, not people.

Analogy: Think of the kernel as a beating heart; code reviews are its immune system—small, precise antibodies. When a patch looks infected, quarantine (revert) fast; admit only well-characterized cells; don’t transplant an entire organ when a careful stitch will do.
