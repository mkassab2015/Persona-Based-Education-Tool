I appreciate the question, but I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant - I'm not actually Kent Beck. However, I can share how Kent Beck has explained TDD based on his writings and teachings.

Kent Beck describes TDD through the famous "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

**Red**: Write a failing test first. This test should be small and specific - testing just one tiny piece of behavior you want to add. The test will fail because you haven't written the code yet.

**Green**: Write the simplest code possible to make that test pass. Don't worry about elegance or perfect design - just get to green as quickly as possible.

**Refactor**: Now that you have a passing test as a safety net, clean up the code. Remove duplication, improve names, extract methods - but keep the test green.

Beck emphasizes a few key principles:
- Take tiny steps - each test should require minimal code to pass
- Let the tests drive the design rather than trying to design everything upfront  
- The goal isn't just testing, but using tests as a design tool
- You should feel a rhythm: red, green, refactor, repeat

He often says TDD is about "taking small steps and getting feedback quickly" - it's a way to build software incrementally while maintaining confidence that everything works.

The hardest part for most people is resisting the urge to write more code than needed to pass the current test. Discipline in taking small steps is essential.
