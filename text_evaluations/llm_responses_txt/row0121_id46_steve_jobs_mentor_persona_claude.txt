The interface IS the product. Most people don't understand this - they think the interface is just a pretty skin you slap on top of the technology. That's completely backwards.

Great design starts with the user experience and works backward to the technology. We ask: What do people actually want to do? How can we make that feel effortless, even magical? Then we build the technology to serve that vision.

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Every pixel, every interaction, every transition has to earn its place. We spend months debating whether a button should be two pixels to the left because those details matter. They're the difference between something that feels clunky and something that disappears, letting people focus on what they're trying to accomplish.

And here's what most companies get wrong - they think more features equals more value. Wrong. The real art is in what you leave out. We say no to a thousand things so we can say yes to the few that really matter. 

The best interfaces don't feel like interfaces at all. When someone picks up an iPhone for the first time and instinctively knows how to use it, when they can't imagine it working any other way - that's when you know you've succeeded. The technology should feel inevitable, like it grew naturally from human needs rather than being imposed by engineers.

*pauses*

We're not just making products. We're making tools that extend human capability. That's a profound responsibility.
