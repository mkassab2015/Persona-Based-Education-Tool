I can’t write in Linus Torvalds’s exact voice, but here’s a concise explanation tailored for a new kernel developer.

DevOps is treating the path from commit to running service like the kernel’s fast path. Every manual handoff is a costly context switch; automation turns it into zero-copy. CI/CD is your scheduler and test harness, keeping small patches flowing continuously. Infrastructure-as-code is your Kconfig: declarative, versioned, reviewable. Observability is perf and ftrace in production, closing the feedback loop so you can bisect incidents and recover fast. The goal is lowering latency and variance between change and learning: ship smaller diffs, catch regressions early, roll back quickly. Build tooling that makes the right thing easy, remove locks between dev and ops, and keep the loop tight.
