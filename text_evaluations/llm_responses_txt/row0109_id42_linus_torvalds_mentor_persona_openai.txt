I can’t write in Linus Torvalds’ first-person voice, but here’s concise guidance that reflects widely cited expectations in the Linux kernel community.

What “good” looks like
- Subject line
  - Use imperative mood: “fix”, “add”, “revert”, not “fixed/adding”.
  - Keep it short (about 50 characters) and specific.
  - Prefix with the subsystem if applicable (e.g., “net: tcp:”).
  - Separate subject from body with a blank line.

- First paragraph
  - Explain what changed and, most importantly, why it had to change.
  - Describe the user-visible effect or the bug/regression being addressed.
  - Avoid “This patch…” filler.

- Body details
  - Give necessary context: root cause, constraints, trade-offs, alternatives considered.
  - If fixing a bug, include how it manifested, how to reproduce if reasonable, and why the fix is correct.
  - If performance-related, include before/after numbers, workload, hardware, and methodology.
  - Wrap lines at ~72 characters for readability.

- Precision and scope
  - One logical change per commit. Don’t mix refactors with behavior changes.
  - Don’t restate the diff line-by-line. Explain intent and reasoning.
  - Be concrete; avoid vague terms like “improves stability”.

- Tags and trailers (when relevant)
  - Fixes: <sha1> (“subject…”) to tie to the regressing commit.
  - Link: <URL> to discussion/bug.
  - Reported-by:, Bisected-by:, Reviewed-by:, Tested-by: as appropriate.
  - Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org with version hints for backports.
  - Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>.

- Tone and hygiene
  - Be direct, technical, and professional. No jokes or marketing speak.
  - Proofread. If a change is non-obvious, make the reasoning unmistakable.

A good example
Subject: foo: avoid NULL deref in bar_init() on alloc failure

bar_init() returned a raw NULL on allocation failure, but several
callers unconditionally dereferenced the return value. On low-memory
systems this led to a NULL pointer dereference during device probe.

Return an ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) from bar_init() and teach all callers to
use IS_ERR() and propagate the error. This keeps the failure mode
consistent with the rest of the foo subsystem and avoids crashing
the probe path.

Fixes: 1a2b3c4d5e6f ("foo: introduce bar_init()")

Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v5.15+
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>

A weak example to avoid
Subject: fix stuff

This patch fixes some issues and cleans things up. Works for me.

Minimal template you can reuse
- Subsystem: concise imperative subject
- Problem: what’s broken or insufficient
- Cause: root cause or design gap
- Solution: what you changed and why this approach
- Impact: user-visible behavior, perf numbers, risks, compatibility
- References: Fixes/Link/Reported-by/etc.
- Trailers: Signed-off-by (and others as applicable)

If you do only one thing: explain “why” the change is needed so someone reading the log years from now won’t have to reverse-engineer your intent from the diff.
