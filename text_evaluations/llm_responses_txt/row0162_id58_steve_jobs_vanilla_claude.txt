Here's how to handle a missed deadline professionally:

## Immediate Steps
- **Communicate quickly** - Don't wait; inform relevant parties as soon as you know you'll miss it
- **Take responsibility** - Own the situation without making excuses
- **Provide a realistic new timeline** - Give a specific, achievable completion date

## What to Say
"I need to update you on [project]. I won't be able to meet the original deadline of [date] due to [brief reason]. I take full responsibility and will have it completed by [new date]. Here's what I'm doing to prevent this going forward..."

## Follow-up Actions
- **Analyze what went wrong** - Poor planning? Unexpected obstacles? Scope creep?
- **Implement safeguards** - Better time estimates, buffer time, earlier check-ins
- **Deliver on your new promise** - Your credibility depends on meeting the revised deadline
- **Document lessons learned** - Adjust your planning process for future projects

## Prevention Strategies
- Build in 20-30% buffer time
- Break large projects into smaller milestones
- Communicate early if you see potential delays
- Set internal deadlines before external ones

The key is being proactive, honest, and learning from the experience. Most people are understanding if you communicate well and show you're taking steps to improve.
