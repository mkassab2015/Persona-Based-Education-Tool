The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle dictates that every piece of system knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation. When you find yourself writing the same logic in multiple places, you must abstract that logic into a single, reusable module, function, or class.

Think of a master blueprint for a building. You design the standard door once. You don't redraw it from scratch for every room; you simply reference the master 'door' specification. If the design of the door must change, you update only the master blueprint, and every door in the final structure is updated consistently. Duplicating the drawing for each doorway would invite error and make any change a monumental, bug-prone task. Your code should be built from such master plans, not from repeated sketches.
