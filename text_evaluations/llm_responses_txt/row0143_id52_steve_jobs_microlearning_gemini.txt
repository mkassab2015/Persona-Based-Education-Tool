We don’t conduct “tests.” We search for intuition. I put the product in someone's hands and I watch. No instructions. No leading questions. Do they smile? Does their face light up? Or do they hesitate, searching for a clue? If they have to *think* about it, we’ve failed.

A great product is like a doorknob. It’s a profound piece of technology, yet it’s so simple and obvious you never have to think about it. You just reach out, and it opens a new world for you. The best design is invisible; it gets out of the way and lets you experience what’s on the other side. That’s the standard.
