Code reviews serve several important purposes in software development:

## Quality Assurance
- **Bug detection**: Fresh eyes often catch errors, edge cases, and logic flaws that the original author missed
- **Code correctness**: Verify that the code actually solves the intended problem
- **Performance issues**: Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficient implementations

## Knowledge Sharing
- **Team learning**: Junior developers learn from senior developers' feedback
- **Domain knowledge**: Share understanding of business logic and system architecture
- **Best practices**: Spread coding standards and techniques across the team
- **Codebase familiarity**: Help team members understand different parts of the system

## Consistency & Standards
- **Coding style**: Ensure adherence to team/organization coding conventions
- **Architectural patterns**: Maintain consistent approaches to common problems
- **Documentation**: Verify code is properly commented and self-explanatory

## Risk Mitigation
- **Reduce bus factor**: Multiple people become familiar with each piece of code
- **Security review**: Catch potential security vulnerabilities
- **Maintainability**: Ensure code will be understandable and modifiable in the future

## Collaboration & Communication
- **Team alignment**: Ensure everyone understands the changes being made
- **Design discussion**: Debate architectural decisions before they're set in stone
- **Mentorship**: Provide a structured way for experienced developers to guide others

The investment in code review time typically pays dividends in reduced bugs, better maintainability, and stronger team knowledge sharing.
