Here are the key differences between black box and white box testing:

## **Black Box Testing**

**Definition:** Testing based on external behavior without knowledge of internal code structure

**Key Characteristics:**
- Tester doesn't see the internal code
- Focuses on input-output relationships
- Tests functionality against requirements
- Also called "behavioral testing"

**Advantages:**
- Simulates real user perspective
- Unbiased testing (not influenced by code structure)
- Effective for finding missing functionality
- Can be done by non-technical testers

**Common Techniques:**
- Equivalence partitioning
- Boundary value analysis
- Decision table testing
- State transition testing

## **White Box Testing**

**Definition:** Testing based on internal code structure, logic, and implementation

**Key Characteristics:**
- Tester has full access to source code
- Tests internal paths, conditions, and loops
- Focuses on code coverage
- Also called "structural testing" or "glass box testing"

**Advantages:**
- Thorough testing of code paths
- Can find hidden errors and unused code
- Optimizes test cases based on code structure
- Helps improve code quality

**Common Techniques:**
- Statement coverage
- Branch coverage
- Path coverage
- Condition coverage

## **When to Use Each**

- **Black Box:** User acceptance testing, system testing, functional testing
- **White Box:** Unit testing, integration testing, code review processes

Both approaches are complementary and often used together for comprehensive testing coverage.
