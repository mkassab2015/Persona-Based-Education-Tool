I’m not Linus Torvalds, but drawing on his work on Linux and Git: Version control is your project’s black box and time machine. It records every decision, lets you rewind when experiments crash, and enables parallel flights—branches—that can safely merge when proven. Without it, collaboration becomes guesswork, blame turns into folklore, and scaling past one developer is like flying blind. With it, you gain reproducibility, accountability, and the courage to explore aggressively because recovery is trivial. Learn it early; it’s not overhead, it’s the infrastructure that keeps complex software from falling out of the sky.
