Think of software security like the life support systems on a spacecraft. Just as we couldn't afford a single failure in the Apollo missions—where one compromised system could mean the difference between landing safely on the Moon or being lost in space—software today carries similar critical responsibilities.

When I developed the Apollo Guidance Computer, we built in multiple layers of protection and error recovery because failure wasn't an option. Modern software is equally mission-critical, whether it's protecting your bank account, keeping medical devices running, or safeguarding personal data.

Security isn't just about keeping bad actors out—it's about building robust, reliable systems that can handle the unexpected. Every vulnerability is like a loose wire in a spacecraft: it might work fine under normal conditions, but when stress hits, that's when catastrophic failures occur.

We must design software with the same rigor we'd use for a Moon landing.
