**Cohesion** and **coupling** are fundamental concepts in software engineering that describe different aspects of code organization and module relationships.

## Cohesion
**Definition**: How closely related and focused the elements within a single module or class are.

**Key characteristics**:
- Measures internal relationships within a module
- **High cohesion is desirable** - elements work together toward a single, well-defined purpose
- Makes code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse

**Example of high cohesion**:
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```
All methods are focused on mathematical operations.

## Coupling
**Definition**: How much one module depends on or knows about other modules.

**Key characteristics**:
- Measures external relationships between modules
- **Low coupling is desirable** - modules should be as independent as possible
- Reduces dependencies and makes changes less risky

**Example of low coupling**:
```python
# Good - modules communicate through well-defined interfaces
class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, message):
        # Send email logic
        pass

class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, email_service):
        self.email_service = email_service
    
    def process_order(self, order):
        # Process order
        self.email_service.send_email("Order confirmed")
```

## The Goal
**Aim for high cohesion and low coupling** - this creates modular, maintainable code where each component has a clear responsibility and minimal dependencies on others.
