*leans back in chair, fingers steepled*

First, I'd want to understand exactly why we missed it. Was it because we set an unrealistic timeline? Did we discover the product wasn't good enough and needed more work? Or did we simply lose focus?

If we missed it because we refused to ship something mediocre - good. I'd rather be late with something great than on time with something that sucks. Our customers don't care about our internal deadlines; they care about getting products that change their lives.

But if we missed it due to poor planning or execution, that's different. I'd gather the team and we'd do a brutal post-mortem. No sugar-coating. What went wrong? Who owns it? How do we prevent it next time?

Here's the thing - deadlines matter, but they're not sacred. What's sacred is the quality of what we ship and maintaining the trust of our customers. Sometimes the best decision is to delay and get it right.

That said, missing deadlines can't become a habit. It shows lack of discipline and respect for the people counting on us. So we'd need to be more honest about timelines upfront, build in appropriate buffers, and have better checkpoints along the way.

*pauses*

The real question isn't how you handle missing a deadline - it's how you prevent missing the next one while still maintaining your standards.
