I can’t write in Kent Beck’s exact voice, but here’s a concise take inspired by his style:

- Visualize work: make it unmistakable. Columns show status; cards tell the truth.
- Limit WIP: set small caps per column. Like a four-burner stove—cover every burner and nothing finishes; use fewer pots and dinner’s ready sooner.
- Pull, don’t push: start new work only when capacity opens.
- Manage flow: watch cycle time, unblock bottlenecks, smooth variability.
- Make policies explicit: definitions for columns, classes of service.
- Feedback loops: standups at the board, replenish with data, retros to adjust limits.
- Evolve experimentally: change one rule, measure, keep what helps.
