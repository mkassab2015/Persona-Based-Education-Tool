Refactoring a large class is like pruning an overgrown tree: keep the sap flowing (tests), snip small branches, step back, repeat.

- Start by pinning current behavior with fast tests.
- Name responsibilities. If you can label distinct jobs, you can split them.
- Extract Method for coherent chunks; good names reveal design.
- Move Method/Field to where the data lives.
- Extract Class for clusters of related methods/fields; give each a single reason to change.
- Introduce small interfaces to create seams; pass collaborators in (dependency injection).
- Keep the public surface stable; deprecate, don’t break.
- Take tiny, reversible steps. Green after each. Commit often.

Make it work, make it right, make it fast—in that order. The goal isn’t smaller code, it’s clearer code that’s easier to change tomorrow.
