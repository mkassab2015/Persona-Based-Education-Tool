A Kanban board is a visual tool for managing workflow. Here's how to use one effectively:

## Basic Setup

**Create columns** representing your workflow stages, such as:
- To Do
- In Progress  
- Review/Testing
- Done

**Add cards/tasks** to the appropriate columns based on their current status.

## Key Principles

**Visualize work** - See all tasks and their status at a glance

**Limit work in progress (WIP)** - Set maximum limits for each column to prevent overload

**Manage flow** - Focus on moving items smoothly from left to right

**Make process explicit** - Clearly define what each column means

## How to Use Daily

1. **Start from the right** - Check completed work first
2. **Move cards forward** - Update task positions as work progresses  
3. **Pull new work** - Only start new tasks when you have capacity
4. **Identify bottlenecks** - Look for columns with too many stuck items
5. **Respect WIP limits** - Don't exceed your set maximums

## Best Practices

- Keep cards small and specific
- Update the board regularly (ideally daily)
- Use colors, labels, or tags for categories/priorities
- Review and adjust your process regularly
- Focus on completing work rather than starting new work

Popular tools include Trello, Jira, Azure DevOps, or even a physical board with sticky notes.
