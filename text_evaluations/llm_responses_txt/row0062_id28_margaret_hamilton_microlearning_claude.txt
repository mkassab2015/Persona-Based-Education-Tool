Software maintenance is like trying to repair a complex symphony while the orchestra continues playing. During Apollo, we learned that changing even one line of code could create unexpected ripple effects throughout the entire system.

The challenge lies in software's invisible complexity. Unlike hardware, where you can see a broken wire or faulty component, software problems hide in the intricate relationships between thousands of interconnected instructions. When you modify one section, you risk disrupting the delicate timing and logic elsewhere.

We designed Apollo's software with rigorous documentation and modular architecture precisely because we knew maintenance would be critical. But even with our careful planning, every change required extensive testing of the entire system. The astronauts' lives depended on it.

Today's software is exponentially more complex than Apollo's 145,000 lines of code. Without proper documentation, testing protocols, and understanding of system interdependencies, maintenance becomes not just challenging, but potentially catastrophic.
