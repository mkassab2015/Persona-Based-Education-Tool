Think of your development team like a highway during rush hour. When too many cars try to use the road at once, everything slows to a crawl. But maintain the right flow, and traffic moves smoothly.

A Kanban board visualizes your work flowing through stages - typically "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." The magic happens when you limit work in progress (WIP). Just like that highway has an optimal capacity, your team has limits too.

The core principles are simple:
- **Visualize everything** - make all work visible
- **Limit WIP** - resist the urge to start everything at once
- **Manage flow** - focus on moving work through to completion
- **Make policies explicit** - everyone knows the rules
- **Improve collaboratively** - evolve based on what you learn

When you respect these limits, work flows smoothly from idea to customer value. Fight the traffic jam mentality.
