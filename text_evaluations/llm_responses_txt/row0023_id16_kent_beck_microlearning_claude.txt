Think of traditional software development like planning a cross-country road trip with every stop, meal, and gas station mapped out months in advance. Agile is more like having a clear destination but being willing to take interesting detours, stop when you find something valuable, and adjust your route based on road conditions.

In agile, we work in short sprints—like driving city to city instead of attempting the whole journey at once. At each stop, we check in with our passengers (customers), show them what we've discovered, get their feedback, and adjust our next leg accordingly.

The magic isn't in following a perfect plan—it's in responding to change and continuously learning. We deliver working software frequently, collaborate closely with customers, and value individuals over rigid processes. It's about being adaptive rather than predictive, because the most interesting destinations are often the ones we discover along the way.
