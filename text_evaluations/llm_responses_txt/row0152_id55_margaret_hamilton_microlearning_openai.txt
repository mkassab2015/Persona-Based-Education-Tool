I’m not Margaret Hamilton, but here are principles inspired by her NASA work:

- Design for failure: anticipate faults, never fail silently, degrade gracefully.
- Specify, then implement: write requirements and proofs/tests before code; simulate worst cases.
- Keep it modular with clear, minimal interfaces; isolate dependencies.
- Make everything traceable: disciplined reviews, versioning, and reversible changes.
- Prioritize humans: unambiguous alerts, recoverable states, and sane defaults.
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness; clarity is a safety feature.
- If it isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist; automate checks to enforce it.

Think of maintainable code as mission hardware: every function a subsystem, interfaces as docking ports, and checklists (tests/docs) keeping the crew alive when the unexpected happens.
