Short version:
- Own it quickly.
- Give a clear new plan and date.
- Offer options to reduce impact.
- Communicate proactively until it’s done.
- Fix the root cause so it doesn’t repeat.

Practical playbook

1) Triage first (60–90 minutes)
- Clarify the target: What exactly is due? What is “must have” vs “nice to have”?
- Measure the gap: What’s done, what remains, blockers, dependencies.
- Re-estimate honestly: Remaining hours ÷ realistic focus hours/day. Add 20–30% buffer.
- Identify options to reduce impact:
  - Deliver a usable partial now.
  - De-scope to a minimum viable version, phase the rest.
  - Get help or swap priorities with your manager.
  - Run work in parallel where safe.

2) Communicate early and clearly
- Choose channel by impact/urgency: call or quick meeting for high-stakes; otherwise Slack/email. Don’t wait.
- Message components:
  - Acknowledge the miss (or near miss).
  - Own it without excuses.
  - State current status and impact.
  - Present a recovery plan with a specific new date and milestones.
  - Offer options/trade-offs.
  - Ask for what you need (time, help, decisions).
  - Commit to checkpoints.

Template you can adapt (email/Slack)
- Subject: Revised plan for [deliverable] — new target [date]
- Message:
  Hi [Name],
  I missed the [original date] deadline for [deliverable]. Current status: [what’s done], remaining: [what’s left]. The impact is [brief impact].
  Recovery plan:
  - Milestone 1: [what] by [date/time]
  - Milestone 2: [what] by [date/time]
  - Final delivery: [date]
  Options to reduce impact:
  - Option A: Deliver [partial] today so [benefit].
  - Option B: De-scope [items] now; deliver them by [follow-up date].
  I take responsibility for the miss. To hit the new date, I need: [help/resources/decision]. I’ll provide updates [cadence] and flag risk immediately.
  Does Option A or B work best? If neither, I’m open to alternatives.
  Thanks, [You]

One-minute call script
- “I want to flag I’ve missed/will miss the [date] deadline on [deliverable]. Here’s where it stands: [status]. I estimate completion by [new date] with these milestones: [list]. To reduce impact, we could [option A] or [option B]. I own the miss and will send daily updates. Which option do you prefer, or would you like to adjust scope differently?”

3) Execute the recovery plan
- Start with any partial handoff that unblocks others.
- Give short daily updates: done, next, risks, help needed.
- If risk increases, re-negotiate immediately—don’t “hope it works out.”

4) After it’s delivered: prevent repeat misses
- Do a brief retro:
  - Estimation error? Unclear requirements? Hidden dependencies? Over-commitment? Distractions?
- Fix the system:
  - Add 20–30% buffer on complex tasks; use three-point estimates (best/likely/worst).
  - Break work into smaller milestones with interim check-ins or demos.
  - Surface dependencies early; keep a simple risk list.
  - Time-block deep work and protect it; reduce task switching.
  - Agree on status cadence (e.g., twice-weekly progress note).
  - Align priorities with your manager to prevent overload; ask for explicit trade-offs.

What not to do
- Don’t go silent or hope to “make it up” without telling anyone.
- Don’t blame others; state facts and where you need help.
- Don’t give a new date without a plan and buffers.
- Don’t backdate or misrepresent progress.

If you’re about to miss vs. already missed
- About to miss: communicate as soon as you see risk, even 24–48 hours ahead. You’ll have more options (scope cut, help, sequence change).
- Already missed with no prior warning: apologize for the lack of early notice, explain briefly why you didn’t flag it, and state the new process to avoid silence going forward.

Special contexts
- Client-facing: pair the plan with options; if impact is significant, consider a goodwill gesture (small discount/extra support), clear boundaries, and a formal revised SOW if scope changes.
- Academic: email the professor/TA ASAP, acknowledge the miss, request an extension with a specific date, offer partial submission now, and provide documentation if relevant.
- Regulatory/legal deadlines: escalate to leadership and legal immediately; implement a documented interim control or workaround while you execute the recovery plan.

If you want, tell me the situation (what the deliverable is, who the stakeholder is, what’s left, and your earliest realistic date), and I’ll draft a tailored message and recovery plan.
