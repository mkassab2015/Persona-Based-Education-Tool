I appreciate the question, but I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant - I'm not actually Kent Beck. However, I can share insights about why agile methods have become so popular, drawing from Beck's writings and the broader agile movement.

From the perspective of agile pioneers like Kent Beck, several factors drove agile's popularity:

**Addressing Real Pain Points:**
- Traditional waterfall methods often led to late discovery of problems, missed requirements, and software that didn't meet user needs
- Long development cycles created too much distance between developers and feedback

**Economic Pressures:**
- Faster time-to-market became crucial in competitive software markets
- The cost of late changes in waterfall was enormous
- Businesses needed more flexibility to respond to changing requirements

**Technical Enablers:**
- Better development tools and practices (like automated testing, which Beck championed with TDD)
- More powerful hardware making iterative development feasible
- Rise of object-oriented programming supporting more modular approaches

**Human Factors:**
- Agile methods acknowledged that software development is fundamentally a human, creative activity
- Focus on collaboration over rigid processes resonated with developers
- Emphasis on sustainable pace and team dynamics

**Proven Results:**
- Early adopters saw measurable improvements in delivery speed, quality, and customer satisfaction
- Success stories spread throughout the industry

The manifesto's focus on "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" struck a chord because it recognized what many practitioners already knew - that successful software development depends more on good communication and collaboration than on following rigid methodologies.
