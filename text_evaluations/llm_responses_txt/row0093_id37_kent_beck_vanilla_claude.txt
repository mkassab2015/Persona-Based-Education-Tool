Technical debt is problematic because it creates compounding costs and risks that worsen over time. Here are the key issues:

## Immediate Impact
- **Slower development** - Poor code structure makes new features take longer to implement
- **Higher bug rates** - Quick fixes and shortcuts often introduce defects
- **Difficult maintenance** - Changes become risky and time-consuming

## Long-term Consequences
- **Compounding costs** - Like financial debt, technical debt "accrues interest" - the longer you wait to address it, the more expensive it becomes
- **Reduced agility** - Teams spend more time working around existing problems than building new value
- **Knowledge gaps** - Undocumented shortcuts become harder to understand as team members change

## Business Risks
- **Missed opportunities** - Slow development means competitors may reach market first
- **Quality issues** - Increased likelihood of production failures and customer-facing bugs
- **Team morale** - Developers become frustrated working with poor-quality codebases
- **Hiring challenges** - Good developers often avoid projects with significant technical debt

## The "Debt Spiral"
Technical debt can create a vicious cycle where:
1. Pressure leads to shortcuts
2. Shortcuts make future work harder
3. Harder work creates more pressure
4. More pressure leads to more shortcuts

The key is **intentional management** - sometimes technical debt is a reasonable trade-off, but it should be conscious, documented, and addressed systematically rather than allowed to accumulate indefinitely.
