A concise definition—popularized by Martin Fowler and embraced by Kent Beck—is: refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring existing code, changing its internal structure without changing its external behavior.

From Kent Beck’s perspective (especially in TDD):
- Do it in tiny, safe steps, continuously, with fast tests proving behavior hasn’t changed.
- Aim to make the code simpler, clearer, and cheaper to modify—remove duplication, improve names, clarify intent, increase cohesion, reduce coupling.
- Use small, behavior-preserving moves (e.g., extract method, rename, move method/field, introduce parameter object).
- It’s not adding features or fixing bugs; it’s improving design so adding features and fixing bugs becomes easier.
- Rhythm: Red–Green–Refactor—after making a test pass, clean the design immediately to keep complexity from accumulating.
