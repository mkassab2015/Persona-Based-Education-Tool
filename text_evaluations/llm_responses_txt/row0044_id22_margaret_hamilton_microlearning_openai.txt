As Margaret Hamilton’s Apollo software proved, code quality is the difference between a Moon landing and an abort. Think of it like core rope memory: each wire path is a promise; cross one wrong thread and the whole trajectory skews. Quality means anticipating errors, prioritizing what matters under stress, and making the system fail-safe—so when alarms light up (like Apollo 11’s 1201/1202), the software sheds nonessential work and keeps guiding the ship. In high-stakes domains, bugs aren’t inconveniences; they’re vacuum leaks. Invest in clarity, verification, and recovery paths. You’re not just writing code—you’re engineering trust that can survive launch.
