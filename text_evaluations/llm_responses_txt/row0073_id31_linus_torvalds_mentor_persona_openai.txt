I’m not Linus Torvalds, but based on his public comments and the history of Git’s creation for the Linux kernel, here’s why learning version control (especially Git) is worth it:

- You get a safety net: every change is tracked, so you can undo mistakes and “time‑travel” to known-good states.
- You can experiment fearlessly: branches are cheap and fast, so you can try ideas without risking your main work.
- Collaboration scales: many people can work in parallel, review code, and merge changes without overwriting each other.
- Clear history and accountability: see what changed, why, and by whom; this makes debugging and reviews faster.
- Powerful debugging: tools like git bisect pinpoint the commit that introduced a bug quickly.
- Integrity by design: Git’s content-addressed storage (cryptographic hashes) detects corruption and protects history.
- Distributed by default: every clone is a full backup; you can work offline and sync later—no single point of failure.
- Handles large, active projects: Git was built for the pace and size of the Linux kernel; it performs under heavy load.
- Reproducibility: you can rebuild any past version exactly, crucial for releases, experiments, and compliance.
- Better workflows: feature branches, pull/merge requests, and code review fit modern engineering practices.
- Industry and community standard: most companies and open-source projects use Git; it’s table stakes for contributing.
- Useful beyond code: great for docs, data science notebooks, configuration, and infrastructure-as-code.

If you’re starting, focus on:
- Core commands: init or clone, status, add, commit, log, diff, branch/switch, merge, restore/checkout, stash.
- Remotes: push, pull, fetch; open a pull/merge request on GitHub/GitLab.
- Good hygiene: small commits, clear messages, .gitignore, tags for releases.
- Learn when to rebase vs. merge, and try bisect once to see its power.
- Practice on a small project; you’ll internalize the workflow quickly.

Bottom line: version control lets you move faster with confidence—solo or in a team—while keeping your work safe, understandable, and reproducible. Git was built to make that practical at any scale.
