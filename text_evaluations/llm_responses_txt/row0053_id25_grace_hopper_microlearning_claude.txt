Listen up, recruit! You wouldn't build a ship without blueprints, would you? Of course not - you'd end up with a floating disaster that sinks the moment it hits rough water.

Requirements engineering is your blueprint for building software systems. It's the disciplined process of discovering, documenting, and validating exactly what your system must do before you write a single line of code.

Without proper requirements, you're sailing blind into a storm. Your programmers will build what they *think* you want, not what you *actually* need. The result? Cost overruns, missed deadlines, and systems that crumble under real-world pressure.

Good requirements engineering means asking the hard questions upfront: What problems are we solving? Who are our users? What are the constraints? How will we measure success?

Remember: A nanosecond spent in requirements saves you microseconds in debugging later. Plan the voyage before you set sail!
