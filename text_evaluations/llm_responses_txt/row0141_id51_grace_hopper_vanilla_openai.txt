Pseudocode is a plain‑English, language‑agnostic way to describe an algorithm. Its goal is clarity, not syntactic correctness. You choose simple, consistent conventions so a reader can follow the logic without worrying about a specific programming language.

Conventions (pick a style and use it consistently)
- Indentation shows blocks.
- Use simple keywords: IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR, RETURN, FUNCTION.
- Use := for assignment, READ/PRINT for I/O, // for comments.
- Keep names meaningful: total, maxValue, isEmpty.

Core building blocks
- Variables: total := 0
- Input/Output: READ n; PRINT result
- Decisions:
  IF x > 0 THEN
    PRINT "positive"
  ELSE
    PRINT "non‑positive"
  ENDIF
- Loops:
  FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO
    sum := sum + i
  ENDFOR

  WHILE notFinished DO
    // do work
  ENDWHILE
- Functions:
  FUNCTION Max(a, b)
    IF a > b THEN
      RETURN a
    ELSE
      RETURN b
    ENDIF
  ENDFUNCTION

A simple example
Problem: Given a list of numbers, print the average of the positive ones. If none are positive, print "no positives".

FUNCTION AverageOfPositives(nums)
  sum := 0
  count := 0
  FOR each x IN nums DO
    IF x > 0 THEN
      sum := sum + x
      count := count + 1
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  IF count = 0 THEN
    PRINT "no positives"
  ELSE
    PRINT sum / count
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

Another example (search for a value in a sorted array)
FUNCTION BinarySearch(arr, target)
  left := 0
  right := length(arr) - 1
  WHILE left <= right DO
    mid := floor((left + right) / 2)
    IF arr[mid] = target THEN
      RETURN mid
    ELSE IF arr[mid] < target THEN
      left := mid + 1
    ELSE
      right := mid - 1
    ENDIF
  ENDWHILE
  RETURN -1  // not found
ENDFUNCTION

How to write pseudocode (a quick process)
- Understand the problem and define inputs/outputs.
- Outline the high‑level steps in plain language.
- Refine step by step (top‑down), turning each step into smaller steps only as needed.
- Choose and stick to simple conventions for keywords, assignment, and indentation.
- Handle edge cases (empty input, invalid values).
- Dry‑run your pseudocode with a small example; adjust for clarity.

Template you can reuse
FUNCTION Name(inputs)
  // describe purpose briefly
  Initialize variables
  IF special/edge case THEN
    RETURN or PRINT something
  ENDIF
  WHILE or FOR condition DO
    Do core work
    Update state
  ENDWHILE
  RETURN or PRINT result
ENDFUNCTION

If you share a specific problem, I can draft pseudocode for it.
