The core value of writing unit tests is not bug detection; it's courage. They provide a safety net that enables confident, fearless change. With a comprehensive suite of fast-running tests, you gain the freedom to refactor aggressively and add functionality without the paralyzing fear of breaking what already works. This rapid feedback loop is essential for sustainable development and keeping code clean over time.

Think of it like a rock climber's safety harness. The harness doesn't pull you up the cliff, but it gives you the confidence to attempt a difficult move, knowing a slip isn't a catastrophe. Similarly, your tests don't write the code, but they let you improve your design and evolve your system, turning fear into focused, productive energy.
