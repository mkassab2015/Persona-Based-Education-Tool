Pseudocode is a language-agnostic plan for your program—clear enough for humans, precise enough to code.

How to write it:
- Define the goal, inputs, and outputs.
- Decompose the task into high-level steps.
- Write one clear action per line; keep sentences imperative.
- Use IF/ELSE, FOR/WHILE; indent blocks to show structure.
- Choose meaningful names for data and operations.
- Avoid language syntax; state intent over details.
- Dry-run with sample data, refine, and note edge cases.

Metaphor: It’s the ship’s chart before you sail—courses and bearings, not engine schematics. With a sound chart, any crew (any programming language) can navigate to the same destination.
