Test-driven development (TDD) follows a simple cycle called "Red-Green-Refactor":

## The TDD Cycle

### 1. **Red** - Write a failing test
- Write the smallest possible test for functionality that doesn't exist yet
- Run the test to confirm it fails (this ensures your test is actually testing something)

### 2. **Green** - Write minimal code to pass
- Write just enough code to make the test pass
- Don't worry about perfect code yet - focus on making it work

### 3. **Refactor** - Improve the code
- Clean up the code while keeping tests passing
- Remove duplication, improve naming, enhance structure

## Simple Example

```python
# Step 1: RED - Write failing test
def test_add_two_numbers():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5  # This will fail - add() doesn't exist

# Step 2: GREEN - Minimal implementation
def add(a, b):
    return 5  # Hardcoded to pass the test

# Add another test
def test_add_different_numbers():
    assert add(1, 4) == 5
    assert add(10, 15) == 25  # This will fail

# Step 2: GREEN - Better implementation
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # Now both tests pass

# Step 3: REFACTOR - Code is already clean for this simple example
```

## Key Principles

- **Write tests first** - before any production code
- **Small steps** - write one small test at a time
- **Only write code to pass tests** - resist adding "future" features
- **Keep tests simple and focused** - one concept per test
- **Run tests frequently** - after each small change

## Benefits

- **Better design** - writing tests first forces you to think about interfaces
- **Confidence** - comprehensive test coverage from the start
- **Documentation** - tests serve as examples of how code should work
- **Regression protection** - catch bugs when making changes

Start with a simple function or class and try the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. It feels awkward at first but becomes natural with practice!
