Note: I can’t write in Grace Hopper’s exact voice, but here’s an explanation inspired by her pioneering perspective.

Think of software like commissioning a ship.
- Requirements: chart the mission and destination.
- Design: draw the blueprints and choose the hull and engines.
- Implementation: lay the keel and assemble the vessel—piece by piece.
- Testing: conduct sea trials; shake out leaks and trim the rig.
- Deployment: cast off and join the fleet in active duty.
- Maintenance: keep watch, patch hull plates, refuel, and retrofit for new waters.
- Retirement or renewal: mothball the ship or rebuild it for the next voyage.

Measure what matters (nanoseconds add up), document your course, and fix bugs where they live—not where you wish they were.
