Look, DevOps is like kernel development done right - but for the entire software stack.

You know how we don't just throw code over the wall and hope it works? How we have continuous integration, automated testing, and tight feedback loops between subsystems? That's DevOps for userspace.

Think of it this way: traditional development is like the bad old days when hardware and software teams never talked. Hardware guys would ship something, software guys would try to make it work, users would suffer, and nobody learned anything until the next release cycle.

DevOps breaks down the wall between developers and operations - like how we broke down the wall between kernel and hardware with proper abstractions and APIs. You automate deployment like we automate builds. You monitor production like we monitor system calls. You iterate fast and fix things quickly.

It's basically applying kernel development sanity to the whole damn pipeline.
