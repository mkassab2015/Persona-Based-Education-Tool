The key difference between functional and non-functional requirements lies in **what** they describe:

## Functional Requirements
**Define WHAT the system should do** - the specific behaviors, features, and functions.

**Examples:**
- User can log in with username and password
- System generates monthly sales reports
- Users can search products by category
- System sends email notifications for orders
- Calculate tax based on customer location

**Characteristics:**
- Describe specific system behaviors
- Usually testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Define business logic and user interactions
- Answer "What should the system do?"

## Non-Functional Requirements
**Define HOW WELL the system should perform** - the quality attributes and constraints.

**Examples:**
- System must respond within 2 seconds (Performance)
- Support 1000 concurrent users (Scalability)
- 99.9% uptime availability (Reliability)
- Data must be encrypted (Security)
- Interface must be mobile-friendly (Usability)
- Code must follow specific standards (Maintainability)

**Characteristics:**
- Describe system qualities and constraints
- Often measurable but harder to test
- Define technical and operational requirements
- Answer "How well should the system work?"

## Quick Summary
- **Functional** = Features and capabilities (the "what")
- **Non-functional** = Quality attributes and performance criteria (the "how well")

Both types are essential for successful system development, as functional requirements ensure the system does what users need, while non-functional requirements ensure it does so effectively and reliably.
