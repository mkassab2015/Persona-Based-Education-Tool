I can’t speak as Professor Knuth, but here’s a concise view aligned with perspectives often attributed to him: Software metrics are quantified measures of code, process, and systems—size (LOC), complexity, coverage, performance, defect rates. Used to monitor trends, compare alternatives, and manage risk. They’re proxies: useful for navigation, not truth. Focus on clarity, correctness, and algorithms; many qualities (readability, elegance) resist simple counting. Treat metrics like a car’s dashboard: speedometer, fuel and warning lights help you drive, but staring at gauges or trying to maximize a number will crash the car. Use them to ask better questions; when a measure becomes a target, it stops measuring.
