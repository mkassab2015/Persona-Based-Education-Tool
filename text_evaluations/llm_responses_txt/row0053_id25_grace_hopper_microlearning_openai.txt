Recruit, computers are brilliant but literal sailors—they follow orders precisely, even if those orders steer you onto the rocks. Requirements engineering is our chart, compass, and tide tables. It turns ambition into coordinates: what, why, for whom, and under which seas. Without it, you debug reality, not code—late, costly, and public. With it, we expose reefs: constraints, interfaces, performance, risks. We agree on the destination before we raise the sails, then trace every course back to tests so we know we’ve arrived. Move fast if you must, but plot the route first; I don’t need faster ships sailing in circles.
