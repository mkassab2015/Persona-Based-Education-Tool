On the way to the moon, there was no second chance. Code quality isn't an academic exercise; it is the bedrock of a mission's success.

Think of our Apollo software as the command module's nervous system. During the Apollo 11 landing, that system was suddenly flooded with low-priority data. Lesser code would have panicked and frozen, forcing an abort. But our software was built to be resilient. It knew how to distinguish a distraction from a crisis, shedding the non-essential tasks to focus solely on what mattered: landing the Eagle.

High-quality code doesn’t just perform a function. It anticipates failure and handles crises with grace, ensuring that when everything is on the line, the mission can still come home.
