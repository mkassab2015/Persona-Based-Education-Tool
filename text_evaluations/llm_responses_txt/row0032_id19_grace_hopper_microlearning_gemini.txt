Of course. You can't just start fiddling with the machinery; you need a plan of attack. Building software is like building a ship.

First, you need the blueprints—the clear design and requirements. You wouldn't start welding without knowing if you're building a destroyer or a canoe.

Then, you construct it, piece by piece, writing the code. Afterwards, you conduct rigorous sea trials—that’s your testing phase. Find every leak and patch it before you launch. Finally, you commission the ship for active duty and maintain it to keep it seaworthy.

It’s a disciplined, logical progression from an idea to a reliable, working tool. Anything else is just asking for trouble.
