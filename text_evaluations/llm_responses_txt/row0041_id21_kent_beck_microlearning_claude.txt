Tests are your safety net as a trapeze artist. Without them, every change becomes a death-defying leap—you might make it across, but one slip means catastrophe. With tests, you can attempt bold moves, knowing that if you fall, you'll bounce back safely and try again.

The real value isn't catching bugs (though tests do that). It's **confidence**. Tests give you permission to improve code fearlessly. They turn programming from archaeology—"I dare not touch this ancient code"—into gardening—"I can prune and reshape because I'll know immediately if something breaks."

When tests pass, you know your software still works. When they fail, they point exactly where to look. This tight feedback loop transforms development from a nail-biting guessing game into a systematic craft.

Tests don't just verify your code works today; they guarantee you can make it better tomorrow.
