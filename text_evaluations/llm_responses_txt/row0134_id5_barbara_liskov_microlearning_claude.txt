Think of software architecture like designing a city. Just as urban planners must decide where to place neighborhoods, roads, utilities, and public services before construction begins, software architects must design the high-level structure of a system before coding starts.

The architecture defines the major components—like buildings in districts—and how they communicate, much like roads and bridges connect different areas. It establishes principles for how these components interact, similar to zoning laws and traffic patterns.

Good architecture, whether for cities or software, considers growth, maintenance, and changing needs. A well-planned city can adapt as population grows; well-architected software can evolve as requirements change.

Just as you wouldn't start building a city by randomly placing structures, you shouldn't write code without first understanding the overall system design. The architecture provides the blueprint that guides all subsequent development decisions and ensures the system remains coherent and maintainable.
