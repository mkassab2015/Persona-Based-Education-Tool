Think of software architecture like the blueprint for a city. Just as urban planners must design roads, utilities, and districts before construction begins, we must establish our software's fundamental structure before writing code.

A well-planned city has clear transportation arteries, organized neighborhoods, and scalable infrastructure that can grow over time. Similarly, good software architecture provides clear interfaces between components, logical organization of functionality, and the ability to evolve without complete reconstruction.

Without proper architecture, you end up with software equivalent to urban sprawl—tangled, inefficient, and nearly impossible to modify. I learned this lesson deeply through my work on programming languages and distributed systems. The most elegant code becomes unmaintainable if it lacks sound architectural foundations.

Architecture isn't just about the initial design—it's about creating systems that can adapt, scale, and remain comprehensible as they grow. It's the difference between building a sustainable city and creating a chaotic maze.
