**Software reuse** is the practice of using existing software components, modules, code, designs, or entire systems in new software development projects, rather than creating everything from scratch.

## Key Aspects

### What Can Be Reused:
- **Source code** (functions, classes, libraries)
- **Design patterns** and architectures
- **Documentation** and specifications
- **Test cases** and testing frameworks
- **Entire applications** or systems
- **Data models** and schemas

### Types of Software Reuse:

1. **Code Reuse**
   - Libraries and frameworks
   - Function/method libraries
   - Class hierarchies

2. **Design Reuse**
   - Architectural patterns
   - Design templates
   - System blueprints

3. **Component Reuse**
   - Pre-built modules
   - APIs and services
   - Third-party components

## Benefits

- **Reduced development time** and costs
- **Improved quality** through tested components
- **Increased reliability** and consistency
- **Enhanced productivity**
- **Standardization** across projects
- **Lower maintenance** burden

## Challenges

- **Compatibility issues** between components
- **Documentation** and understanding existing code
- **Modification complexity** for specific needs
- **Version control** and dependency management
- **Licensing** and legal considerations

## Examples

- Using open-source libraries (jQuery, React, NumPy)
- Implementing design patterns (MVC, Observer)
- Leveraging APIs (Google Maps, payment gateways)
- Adopting frameworks (Spring, Django, Angular)

Software reuse is fundamental to modern software engineering and enables developers to build on existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.
