Here's a systematic approach to refactor a large class:

## 1. **Analyze the Current Class**

First, understand what you're working with:

```python
# Example of a large, problematic class
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_connection = None
        self.email_service = None
        self.payment_gateway = None
        self.inventory_system = None
    
    def process_order(self, order_data):
        # Validation logic
        # Payment processing
        # Inventory updates
        # Email notifications
        # Database operations
        # Logging
        # Tax calculations
        pass
    
    def validate_order(self, order): pass
    def calculate_tax(self, order): pass
    def process_payment(self, order): pass
    def update_inventory(self, order): pass
    def send_confirmation_email(self, order): pass
    def log_transaction(self, order): pass
    def save_to_database(self, order): pass
```

## 2. **Identify Refactoring Opportunities**

Look for these code smells:
- **Single Responsibility Principle violations**: Class doing too many things
- **Long methods**: Methods with 20+ lines
- **Feature envy**: Methods using data from other classes more than their own
- **Data clumps**: Groups of parameters that always appear together
- **Duplicate code**: Similar logic repeated

## 3. **Extract Classes by Responsibility**

Break down by distinct responsibilities:

```python
# Before: One large class
# After: Multiple focused classes

class OrderValidator:
    def validate(self, order):
        # Validation logic only
        pass

class TaxCalculator:
    def calculate_tax(self, order, location):
        # Tax calculation logic only
        pass

class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, payment_gateway):
        self.payment_gateway = payment_gateway
    
    def process_payment(self, order):
        # Payment processing only
        pass

class InventoryManager:
    def __init__(self, inventory_system):
        self.inventory_system = inventory_system
    
    def update
