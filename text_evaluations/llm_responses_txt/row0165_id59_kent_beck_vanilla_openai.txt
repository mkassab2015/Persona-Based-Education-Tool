Kanban is a simple way to manage work by visualizing your workflow and limiting work in progress so tasks flow smoothly from start to finish.

Quick start
- Pick a board: physical (sticky notes) or digital (Trello, Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub Projects, Notion, Asana).
- Map your workflow into columns: example: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review/Testing → Done. Keep it as simple as possible.
- Set explicit policies:
  - Definition of Ready (what must be true to enter “Ready”).
  - Definition of Done (what must be true to enter “Done”).
  - Work-in-progress (WIP) limits per column (e.g., Ready 5, In Progress 3, Review 2). Start low; adjust later.
- Create cards for work items: clear title, brief description, owner, due date/class of service if relevant. Keep items small (1–3 days each when possible).
- Pull work, don’t push:
  - Only move a card right when it meets the policy for that column.
  - Don’t start new work if your column is at its WIP limit. Finish or help finish something first.
  - If blocked, mark the card clearly and swarm to remove the blocker.
- Run a short daily board review (stand-up):
  - What’s blocked? What’s aging (stuck the longest)?
  - Can we finish something today?
  - Only then consider pulling new work.
- Measure and improve:
  - Lead time: from “committed/Ready” to “Done.”
  - Throughput: items finished per week.
  - WIP: number of items in progress.
  - Use simple charts (cumulative flow, aging WIP) if your tool provides them.
  - Adjust WIP limits, column policies, or workflow steps based on what you learn.

Personal Kanban (solo)
- Columns: To Do → Doing → Done.
- WIP limit for Doing: 1–3 max.
- Replenish To Do from a larger backlog weekly; review Done weekly to learn and reprioritize.

Team Kanban (example)
- Columns: Backlog → Ready (WIP 5) → In Progress (WIP 3) → Review/QA (WIP 2) → Done.
- Policies: code reviewed before QA; tests pass before Done; only one Expedite allowed at a time.
- Cadences: quick daily stand-up at the board; weekly replenishment/prioritization; monthly retrospective using lead time/throughput data.

Tips
- Make work small and independent; break big items before pulling.
- Visualize blockers explicitly and limit “Review” work like any other.
- Reserve a tiny capacity for urgent “Expedite” items (e.g., at most 1).
- “Stop starting, start finishing” improves flow and predictability.
- Keep columns meaningful; too many columns create churn.

Common pitfalls
- No WIP limits (it becomes just a to-do list).
- Starting too much work at once.
- Vague policies, so cards bounce back and forth.
- Huge tasks that sit in progress for weeks.
- Ignoring aging items and blockers.

If you share your context (personal vs. team, software vs. ops/marketing, tools you use), I can propose a tailored board layout, WIP limits, and policies.
