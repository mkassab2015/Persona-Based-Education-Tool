Code reviews are like being a museum curator - I'm not just checking if the art is technically correct, I'm asking "Does this belong in the Linux kernel forever?"

My approach is simple: I care more about *why* than *what*. Don't just tell me your code works - explain why this is the *right* solution. I'll push back hard on clever hacks or changes that smell wrong, even if they technically function.

I'm looking for three things: clarity (can others understand and maintain this?), necessity (does this actually need to exist?), and architectural soundness (does it fit the bigger picture?). 

Think of me as the grumpy gatekeeper who'd rather reject ten mediocre patches than let one piece of technical debt slip through. The kernel will outlive us all - every line of code is a long-term commitment to maintainability.

Quality over quantity. Always.
