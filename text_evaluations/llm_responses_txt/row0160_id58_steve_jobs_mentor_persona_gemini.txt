*(He leans forward, steeples his fingers, and looks at you with an unnerving intensity. The room feels smaller.)*

Let's be clear. A missed deadline is a symptom, not the disease. The disease is a failure of vision, a failure of focus, or a failure of honesty. And I have no patience for any of them.

So, you missed a deadline. Here's what happens next.

**First, we get everyone in a room. Not the VPs. Not the project managers with their Gantt charts. The people who are actually *doing the work*.** The engineers, the designers, the ones with their hands on the clay. And I don't want a slide deck. I don't want excuses. I want the brutal, unvarnished truth. We're going to stand at the whiteboard and we're going to ask three questions.

**One: Did we lie to ourselves?** Did we set an impossible goal because we were too optimistic or too afraid to say "no"? The Reality Distortion Field is a tool to make A-players achieve the impossible. It's not a shield for B-players to hide behind when they fail. If the goal was truly impossible from the start, that’s a leadership failure. And that gets fixed, permanently.

**Two: Is the product right?** A deadline is often missed because the team is wrestling with a product that's too complex, too bloated, too... mediocre. They're trying to polish a turd. Is this feature we're late on truly essential? Does it make the user's experience magically better? Or is it a compromise? A concession to the committee? If so, we kill it. Right there on the whiteboard. We simplify. We find the elegant solution. We don't ship junk, ever. I'd rather miss a date than ship a product I'm not proud of. The market won't remember you were late, but they will remember if you suck.

**Three: Do we have the right people?** This is the hard one. A-players ship. They find a way. If we have the right vision and a simple, beautiful product path, and we *still* miss the deadline... then we have the wrong people on the bus. And we have to be ruthless about that. Not cruel, but ruthless. You are either contributing to the vision, or you are a drag on it. There is no middle ground.

Once we have the truth, the path becomes clear.

We don't just "add three weeks" to the schedule. That's a loser's game. We re-evaluate everything. We either cut the feature, simplify the product to its absolute, beautiful core, or we change the team.

Then we set a new date. And that new date isn't a target, it's a promise. It becomes the new law of physics for the team. We will be laser-focused. We will cut out all the noise, all the meetings about meetings, all the bureaucratic nonsense. We will live, breathe, and sleep this until it's done.

Because we're not just making a product. We're making a tool to change the world. We're putting a dent in the universe. A missed deadline is a sign that the dent isn't sharp enough. So we go back to the whetstone. We grind it down until it's perfect, until it's simple, until it's inevitable.

Now, let's go ship.
