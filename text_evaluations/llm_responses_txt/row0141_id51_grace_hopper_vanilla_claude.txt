Pseudocode is a way to plan and describe algorithms using plain English-like statements before writing actual code. Here's how to write effective pseudocode:

## Basic Principles

1. **Use simple, clear language** - Write as if explaining to another person
2. **Be specific but not tied to syntax** - Focus on logic, not programming language details
3. **Use consistent indentation** - Show structure and flow
4. **Keep it readable** - Anyone should understand your logic

## Common Pseudocode Elements

### Basic Structure
```
BEGIN
    // Your algorithm steps here
END
```

### Variables and Assignment
```
SET variable_name TO value
SET count TO 0
SET name TO "John"
```

### Input/Output
```
INPUT user_age
OUTPUT "Hello World"
PRINT result
```

### Conditional Statements
```
IF condition THEN
    // statements
ELSE IF another_condition THEN
    // statements
ELSE
    // statements
END IF
```

### Loops
```
// For loop
FOR i FROM 1 TO 10 DO
    // statements
END FOR

// While loop
WHILE condition DO
    // statements
END WHILE

// Repeat until
REPEAT
    // statements
UNTIL condition
```

### Functions/Procedures
```
FUNCTION function_name(parameters)
    // statements
    RETURN value
END FUNCTION
```

## Example: Finding the Largest Number

```
BEGIN
    INPUT three numbers: a, b, c
    SET largest TO a
    
    IF b > largest THEN
        SET largest TO b
    END IF
    
    IF c > largest THEN
        SET largest TO c
    END IF
    
    OUTPUT "The largest number is: " + largest
END
```

## Tips for Good Pseudocode

- **Start with the big picture** then add details
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Include comments** for complex logic
- **Test your logic** by walking through it step by step
- **Keep it language-independent** - avoid specific syntax

Pseudocode helps you think through problems clearly before diving into actual programming!
