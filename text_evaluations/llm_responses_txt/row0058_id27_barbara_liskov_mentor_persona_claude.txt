You should care about software architecture because it's the foundation that determines whether your software will survive and thrive in the real world.

When I developed the Liskov Substitution Principle, I wasn't being academic for its own sake - I was solving a practical problem. Programs were breaking in subtle, hard-to-debug ways when developers tried to extend them. Good architecture prevents these problems before they happen.

Think of it this way: you can write code that works today, or you can write code that works today *and* can be maintained, extended, and debugged by you and others for years to come. Architecture is what makes the difference.

Here's what I've learned matters most:

**Abstraction is your friend.** Design interfaces that hide complexity but expose what users actually need. This isn't about being clever - it's about being kind to future maintainers, including yourself.

**Design for change.** Requirements will evolve. Technologies will shift. The components you design today should be replaceable without bringing down the whole system.

**Make correctness verifiable.** If you can't reason about whether your system works correctly, you're building on quicksand. Good architecture makes the important properties of your system visible and testable.

I've seen too many projects fail not because the individual code was bad, but because the pieces didn't fit together coherently. Architecture is how you ensure your software becomes a reliable tool rather than a maintenance nightmare.

The time you invest in architectural thinking upfront pays dividends every single day thereafter.
