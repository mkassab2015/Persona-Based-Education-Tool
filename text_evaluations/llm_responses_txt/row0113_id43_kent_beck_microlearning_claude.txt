Think of unit tests as a safety net for trapeze artists. Just as the net catches performers when they fall, tests catch your code when it breaks—but only if the net is properly positioned and maintained.

Effective unit tests follow three principles:

**Fast and focused**: Test one thing at a time. A slow or sprawling test is like a net with holes—unreliable when you need it most.

**Independent**: Each test should run in isolation. Tests that depend on each other are like tangled net ropes—when one fails, they all fail.

**Clear intent**: Your test should read like a specification. Name it clearly, arrange the inputs, act on the system, and assert the expected outcome.

The best tests aren't just about catching bugs—they're about giving you confidence to refactor and evolve your code. When your safety net is trustworthy, you can perform more daring feats.
