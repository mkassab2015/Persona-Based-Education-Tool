Short answer: metrics turn guesswork into decisions.

Why you should care
- Visibility: See what’s really happening (delivery speed, quality, reliability) instead of relying on anecdotes.
- Predictability: Forecast timelines and risks; catch bottlenecks early.
- Quality and reliability: Detect regressions quickly; protect user experience with SLOs and error budgets.
- Efficiency: Focus improvement efforts where they pay off; justify investment in tooling/refactoring with data.
- Alignment: Connect engineering work to business outcomes; build trust with stakeholders.
- Team health: Spot burnout signals (after-hours pages, review queues) and improve ways of working.

Use a small, meaningful set
- Delivery (DORA): lead time for changes, deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR.
- Flow: cycle time distribution, throughput, WIP.
- Reliability: SLOs (e.g., availability, p95 latency) and error budget burn.
- Quality: escaped defects, defect reopen rate, flaky test rate, code review latency.
- Security: time to remediate critical vulnerabilities.
- Cost/efficiency (if cloud/SaaS): cost per request/service, waste from overprovisioning.
- Team health: on-call load, after-hours incidents, survey pulse.

Make them actionable
- Tie each metric to a decision. Example mappings:
  - Long/variable cycle time → reduce WIP, smaller PRs, improve CI.
  - High change failure rate → better tests, trunk-based development, stronger reviews.
  - Slow MTTR → improve observability, runbooks, rollback strategy.
  - Error budget burning → pause risky launches, reliability work first.
  - High review latency → set SLAs, pair/mob review windows.
- Track trends and distributions, not just averages; compare a team to itself over time, not to other teams.

Avoid common traps
- Goodhart’s Law: when a measure becomes a target, it gets gamed. Use metrics to ask questions, not punish.
- Vanity metrics: lines of code, commit counts, story points as productivity.
- Measuring people instead of systems: keep metrics team-level; use them for improvement, not performance reviews.
- Too many metrics: start small; automate collection; review regularly.

Quick start
- Instrument DORA + one SLO that matters to users.
- Baseline for 2–4 weeks; visualize weekly.
- Pick one constraint to address; run a 2–4 week improvement experiment.
- Reassess; add or swap metrics only if they inform a decision you actually make.

Bottom line: metrics give you early warning, clearer trade-offs, and a repeatable way to get faster and more reliable without burning out your team.
