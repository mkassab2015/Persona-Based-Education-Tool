Pair programming is a software development technique where two developers work together on the same task at one computer. One is the “driver” who writes code; the other is the “navigator” who reviews, thinks ahead, and suggests improvements. They switch roles regularly.

Key points:
- Benefits: higher code quality, fewer defects, faster knowledge sharing, better design decisions, reduced “bus factor.”
- Costs/risks: can feel slower short term, pairing fatigue, personality or skill mismatches, not ideal for trivial tasks.
- Best use cases: complex or critical features, tricky debugging, onboarding/junior mentoring, learning a new codebase or tech.
- Good practices: set a clear goal, rotate roles every 15–30 minutes, communicate continuously, take breaks, use TDD if helpful, rotate partners, and use remote pairing tools (shared IDEs, screen share) when distributed.
