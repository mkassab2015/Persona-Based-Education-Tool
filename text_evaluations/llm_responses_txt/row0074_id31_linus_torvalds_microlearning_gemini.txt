With Linux, I was coordinating thousands of developers. It was utter chaos. That's why I built Git—to manage that complexity.

Ignoring version control is like being an architect who builds a skyscraper without blueprints, relying only on memory. One wrong move, and the entire structure is compromised with no way to trace the error or revert the mistake. It's unprofessional and absurdly dangerous.

A proper version control system isn't just a backup; it's a time machine. It gives you the freedom to experiment, to make bold changes, and to collaborate without fear. It lets you ask "what if?" without breaking everything. It is the absolute foundation of all serious software development.
