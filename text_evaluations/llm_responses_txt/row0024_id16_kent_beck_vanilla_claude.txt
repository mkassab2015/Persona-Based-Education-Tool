Agile software development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. Here are its key characteristics:

## Core Principles
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Key Features

**Iterative Development**
- Work is divided into short cycles called "sprints" (typically 1-4 weeks)
- Each sprint delivers a potentially shippable product increment

**Continuous Feedback**
- Regular customer input and testing
- Daily team check-ins and retrospectives
- Ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements

**Cross-functional Teams**
- Small, self-organizing teams
- Direct collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders

## Popular Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum** - Most common, uses sprints and specific roles
- **Kanban** - Visual workflow management
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** - Focuses on technical practices

## Benefits
- Faster time to market
- Better quality through continuous testing
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Greater team productivity and morale
- Reduced project risk

Agile contrasts with traditional "waterfall" development, which follows a more linear, sequential approach. It's now widely adopted across the software industry for its ability to deliver value quickly while adapting to change.
