Software refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior or functionality. The goal is to improve the code's internal structure, readability, and maintainability while keeping the same output and user experience.

## Key Characteristics

- **Behavior preservation**: The software works exactly the same way before and after refactoring
- **Internal improvements**: Focus on code quality, not adding new features
- **Incremental changes**: Usually done in small, manageable steps

## Common Refactoring Techniques

- **Extract Method**: Breaking large functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Rename Variables/Functions**: Using more descriptive names
- **Remove Duplicated Code**: Consolidating repeated logic
- **Simplify Conditional Logic**: Making if-statements clearer
- **Reorganize Classes**: Improving object-oriented design

## Benefits

- **Improved readability**: Easier for developers to understand
- **Reduced complexity**: Simpler code is less prone to bugs
- **Enhanced maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
- **Better performance**: Sometimes results in more efficient code
- **Easier testing**: Well-structured code is simpler to test

## When to Refactor

- Before adding new features
- When fixing bugs
- During code reviews
- When code becomes difficult to understand
- As part of regular maintenance

## Example

```python
# Before refactoring
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item['price'] * item['quantity'] * (1 + item['tax_rate'])
    return total

# After refactoring
def calculate_item_cost(item):
    return item['price'] * item['quantity'] * (1 + item['tax_rate'])

def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(calculate_item_cost(item) for item in items)
```

Refactoring is essential for maintaining healthy, sustainable codebases over time.
