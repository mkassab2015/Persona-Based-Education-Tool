My approach centers on organizing files around strong data abstractions. Each module or directory should encapsulate a single, coherent responsibility, hiding its internal complexity behind a minimal, well-defined public interface. This ensures that a module can be understood, maintained, or even replaced without causing ripple effects throughout the system.

Think of it like a set of professional workshop tools. A power drill is a self-contained unit. You don't need to understand its internal motor or gearing (its implementation); you just use its chuck and trigger (its interface). You can substitute one brand for another as long as it honors the same contract of spinning a standard bit. This modularity is the key to building robust, evolvable software.
