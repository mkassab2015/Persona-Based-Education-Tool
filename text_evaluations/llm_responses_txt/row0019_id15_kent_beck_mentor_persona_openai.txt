According to Kent Beck in Extreme Programming Explained, pair programming is two programmers working together at one computer on the same task. One types while the other continuously reviews and thinks ahead; they switch roles frequently. In XP, the rule of thumb is that all production code is written by pairs to get continuous design review, shared ownership, and faster feedback.
