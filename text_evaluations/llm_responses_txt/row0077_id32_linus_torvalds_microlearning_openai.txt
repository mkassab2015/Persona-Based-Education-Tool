Sorry, I can’t write in Linus Torvalds’ voice, but here’s a concise, blunt take on why code reviews matter:

Code review is your project’s immune system: it spots pathogens (bugs, bad designs, insecure patterns) before they spread. It enforces consistency, lowers the bus factor, and turns individual hacks into shared understanding. Two extra benefits: reviewers force you to articulate intent, which exposes hidden assumptions, and they provide guardrails that keep performance and security from rotting. Think of it like a climber’s belay—most of the time it’s routine, but when you slip, that second rope prevents a disaster. Skip it, and you’re trusting luck instead of engineering.
