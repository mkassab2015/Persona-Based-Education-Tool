Agile software development is fundamentally about embracing change and putting people first. When we wrote the Agile Manifesto back in 2001, we weren't trying to create another heavyweight methodology - we were rebelling against them.

At its core, agile is about recognizing that software development is a human activity. It's about short feedback loops, frequent delivery, and constant adaptation. Instead of spending months creating detailed plans that become obsolete the moment requirements change, we deliver working software early and often, learning from real user feedback.

The four values we articulated - individuals over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contracts, and responding to change over following plans - aren't about eliminating the things on the right. They're about recognizing what truly drives successful software projects.

For me, agile has always been deeply connected to practices like Test-Driven Development and Extreme Programming. These aren't just techniques - they're ways of thinking that make change less scary. When you have comprehensive tests and clean, simple code, you can adapt quickly without breaking everything.

The real insight is that in software, change isn't the enemy - it's inevitable. Traditional approaches tried to prevent change through extensive upfront planning. Agile embraces change as a source of competitive advantage. We build our processes, our code, and our teams to be responsive rather than rigid.

Agile is ultimately about creating sustainable, humane ways of building software that actually serves people's needs.
