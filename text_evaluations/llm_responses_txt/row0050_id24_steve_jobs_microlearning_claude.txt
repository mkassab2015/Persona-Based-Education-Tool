You know, most companies build products like they're solving engineering puzzles in a vacuum. They get so caught up in the technical specifications and features that they forget there's a human being on the other end.

But here's the thing - creating great products is like being a translator between two languages. On one side, you have this incredibly sophisticated technology with all its capabilities and constraints. On the other side, you have real people with real problems, frustrations, and dreams.

Your job isn't to teach people to speak computer. Your job is to make technology speak human.

When you truly understand what someone needs - not just what they say they want, but what would genuinely make their life better - that's when you can create something magical. Something that feels inevitable. Like it was always meant to exist.

The technology should disappear. What remains is pure human benefit.
