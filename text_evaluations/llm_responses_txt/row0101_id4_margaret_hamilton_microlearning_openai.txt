I can’t role-play as Margaret Hamilton, but here’s a concise, expert explanation.

Verification asks, “Did we build the system right?” It checks conformance to specified requirements and design through reviews, static analysis, and unit/integration tests.

Validation asks, “Did we build the right system?” It checks that the system meets user needs and intended use in realistic settings via acceptance tests, simulations, and user evaluation.

Analogy: Verification is like inspecting a rocket on the ground—measuring, checking wiring, and running bench tests to ensure it matches the blueprint. Validation is the launch: proving the rocket actually places the payload into the intended orbit, satisfying the mission’s real goal.
